<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Preface</a></p>

<p>The instruction of the
Kalamas (Kalama Sutta) is justly famous for its encouragement of free
inquiry; the spirit of the sutta signifies a teaching that is exempt
from fanaticism, bigotry, dogmatism, and intolerance.</p>

<p>The reasonableness of the
Dhamma, the Buddha's teaching, is chiefly evident in its welcoming
careful examination at all stages of the path to enlightenment.
Indeed the whole course of training for wisdom culminating in the
purity of the consummate one (the arahant) is intimately bound up
with examination and analysis of things internal: the eye and visible
objects, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and
tastes, the body and tactile impressions, the mind and ideas.</p>

<p>Thus since all phenomena
have to be correctly understood in the field of Dhamma, insight is
operative throughout. In this sutta it is active in rejecting the bad
and adopting the good way; in the extracts given below in clarifying
the basis of knowledge of conditionality and arhatship. Here it may
be mentioned that the methods of examination in the Kalama Sutta and
in the extracts cited here, have sprung from the knowledge of things
as they are and that the tenor of these methods are implied in all
straight thinking. Further, as penetration and comprehension, the
constituents of wisdom are the result of such thinking, the place of
critical examination and analysis in the development of right vision
is obvious. Where is the wisdom or vision that can descend, all of a
sudden, untouched and uninfluenced by a critical thought?</p>

<p>The Kalama Sutta, which
sets forth the principles that should be followed by a seeker of
truth, and which contains a standard things are judged by, belongs to
a framework of the Dhamma; the four solaces taught in the sutta point
out the extent to which the Buddha permits suspense of judgment in
matters beyond normal cognition. The solaces show that the reason for
a virtuous life does not necessarily depend on belief in rebirth or
retribution, but on mental well-being acquired through the overcoming
of greed, hate, and delusion.</p>

<p>More than fifty years
ago, Moncure D. Conway, the author of "My Pilgrimage to the Wise
Men of the East," visited Colombo. He was a friend of
Ponnambalam Ramanathan (then Solicitor General of Ceylon), and
together with him Conway went to the Vidyodaya Pirivena to learn
something of the Buddha's teaching from Hikkaduve Siri Sumangala
Nayaka Thera, the founder of the institution. The Nayaka Thera
explained to them the principles contained in the Kalama Sutta and at
the end of the conversation Ramanathan whispered to Conway: "Is
it not strange that you and I, who come from far different religions
and regions, should together listen to a sermon from the Buddha in
favor of that free thought, that independence of traditional and
fashionable doctrines, which is still the vital principle of human
development?" &mdash; Conway: "Yes, and we with the (Kalama)
princes pronounce his doctrines good."</p>

<p>"Friend Savittha,
apart from faith, apart from liking, apart from what has been
acquired by repeated hearing, apart from specious reasoning, and from
a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over, I know this, I
see this: 'Decay and death are due to birth.'"</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;Samyuttanikaya,
Nidanavagga, Mahavagga, Sutta No. 8</p>

<p>"Here a bhikkhu,
having seen an object with the eye, knows when greed, hate, and
delusion are within, 'Greed, hate, and delusion are in me'; he knows
when greed, hate, and delusion are not within, 'Greed, hate, and
delusion are not in me.' Bhikkhus, have these things to be
experienced through faith, liking, what has been acquired by repeated
hearing, specious reasoning, or a bias towards a notion that has been
pondered over?" &mdash; "No, venerable sir." &mdash;
"Bhikkhus, this even is the way by which a bhikkhu, apart from
faith, liking, what has been acquired by repeated hearing, specious
reasoning, or a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over,
declares realization of knowledge thus: I know that birth has been
exhausted, the celibate life has been lived, what must be done has
been done and there is no more of this to come."</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">The Instruction to the Kalamas</a></p>

<p class="hd">Anguttara Nikaya, Tika Nipata, Mahavagga, Sutta No. 65</p>

<p class="subhd">The
Kalamas of Kesaputta go to see the Buddha</p>

<p>1. I heard thus. Once the
Blessed One, while wandering in the Kosala country with a large
community of bhikkhus, entered a town of the Kalama people called
Kesaputta. The Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta:
"Reverend Gotama, the monk, the son of the Sakyans, has, while
wandering in the Kosala country, entered Kesaputta. The good repute
of the Reverend Gotama has been spread in this way: Indeed, the
Blessed One is thus consummate, fully enlightened, endowed with
knowledge and practice, sublime, knower of the worlds, peerless,
guide of tamable men, teacher of divine and human beings, which he by
himself has through direct knowledge understood clearly. He set forth
the Dhamma, good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the
end, possessed of meaning and the letter, and complete in everything;
and he proclaims the holy life that is perfectly pure. Seeing such
consummate ones is good indeed."</p>

<p>2. Then the Kalamas who
were inhabitants of Kesaputta went to where the Blessed One was. On
arriving there some paid homage to him and sat down on one side; some
exchanged greetings with him and after the ending of cordial
memorable talk, sat down on one side; some saluted him raising their
joined palms and sat down on one side; some announced their name and
family and sat down on one side; some without speaking, sat down on
one side.</p>

<p class="subhd">The
Kalamas of Kesaputta ask for guidance from the Buddha</p>

<p>3. The Kalamas who were
inhabitants of Kesaputta sitting on one side said to the Blessed One:
"There are some monks and brahmans, venerable sir, who visit
Kesaputta. They expound and explain only their own doctrines; the
doctrines of others they despise, revile, and pull to pieces. Some
other monks and brahmans too, venerable sir, come to Kesaputta. They
also expound and explain only their own doctrines; the doctrines of
others they despise, revile, and pull to pieces. Venerable sir, there
is doubt, there is uncertainty in us concerning them. Which of these
reverend monks and brahmans spoke the truth and which falsehood?"</p>

<p class="subhd">The
criterion for rejection</p>

<p>4. "It is proper for
you, Kalamas, to doubt, to be uncertain; uncertainty has arisen in
you about what is doubtful. Come, Kalamas. Do not go upon what has
been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon
rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an
axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion
that has been pondered over; nor upon another's seeming ability; nor
upon the consideration, 'The monk is our teacher.' Kalamas, when you
yourselves know: 'These things are bad; these things are blamable;
these things are censured by the wise; undertaken and observed, these
things lead to harm and ill,' abandon them.</p>

<p class="subhd">Greed,
hate, and delusion</p>

<p>5. "What do you
think, Kalamas? Does greed appear in a man for his benefit or
harm?" &mdash; "For his harm, venerable sir." &mdash;
"Kalamas, being given to greed, and being overwhelmed and
vanquished mentally by greed, this man takes life, steals, commits
adultery, and tells lies; he prompts another too, to do likewise.
Will that be long for his harm and ill?" &mdash; "Yes,
venerable sir."</p>

<p>6. "What do you
think, Kalamas? Does hate appear in a man for his benefit or
harm?" &mdash; "For his harm, venerable sir." &mdash;
"Kalamas, being given to hate, and being overwhelmed and
vanquished mentally by hate, this man takes life, steals, commits
adultery, and tells lies; he prompts another too, to do likewise.
Will that be long for his harm and ill?" &mdash; "Yes,
venerable sir."</p>

<p>7. "What do you
think, Kalamas? Does delusion appear in a man for his benefit or
harm?" &mdash; "For his harm, venerable sir." &mdash;
"Kalamas, being given to delusion, and being overwhelmed and
vanquished mentally by delusion, this man takes life, steals, commits
adultery, and tells lies; he prompts another too, to do likewise.
Will that be long for his harm and ill?" &mdash; "Yes,
venerable sir."</p>

<p>8. "What do you
think, Kalamas? Are these things good or bad?" &mdash; "Bad,
venerable sir" &mdash; "Blamable or not blamable?"
&mdash; "Blamable, venerable sir." &mdash; "Censured or
praised by the wise?" &mdash; "Censured, venerable sir."
&mdash; "Undertaken and observed, do these things lead to harm
and ill, or not? Or how does it strike you?" &mdash;
"Undertaken and observed, these things lead to harm and ill.
Thus it strikes us here."</p>

<p>9. "Therefore, did
we say, Kalamas, what was said thus, 'Come Kalamas. Do not go upon
what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor
upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor
upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a
notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another's seeming
ability; nor upon the consideration, "The monk is our
teacher." Kalamas, when you yourselves know: "These things
are bad; these things are blamable; these things are censured by the
wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to harm and
ill," abandon them.'</p>

<p class="subhd">The
criterion for acceptance</p>

<p>10. "Come, Kalamas.
Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon
tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon
surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a
bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another's
seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, 'The monk is our
teacher.' Kalamas, when you yourselves know: 'These things are good;
these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise;
undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness,'
enter on and abide in them.</p>

<p class="subhd">Absence
of greed, hate, and delusion</p>

<p>11. "What do you
think, Kalamas? Does absence of greed appear in a man for his benefit
or harm?" &mdash; "For his benefit, venerable sir."
&mdash; "Kalamas, being not given to greed, and being not
overwhelmed and not vanquished mentally by greed, this man does not
take life, does not steal, does not commit adultery, and does not
tell lies; he prompts another too, to do likewise. Will that be long
for his benefit and happiness?" &mdash; "Yes, venerable sir."</p>

<p>12. "What do you
think, Kalamas? Does absence of hate appear in a man for his benefit
or harm?" &mdash; "For his benefit, venerable sir."
&mdash; "Kalamas, being not given to hate, and being not
overwhelmed and not vanquished mentally by hate, this man does not
take life, does not steal, does not commit adultery, and does not
tell lies; he prompts another too, to do likewise. Will that be long
for his benefit and happiness?" &mdash; "Yes, venerable sir."</p>

<p>13. "What do you
think, Kalamas? Does absence of delusion appear in a man for his
benefit or harm?" &mdash; "For his benefit, venerable
sir." &mdash; "Kalamas, being not given to delusion, and
being not overwhelmed and not vanquished mentally by delusion, this
man does not take life, does not steal, does not commit adultery, and
does not tell lies; he prompts another too, to do likewise. Will that
be long for his benefit and happiness?" &mdash; "Yes, venerable sir."</p>

<p>14. "What do you
think, Kalamas? Are these things good or bad?" &mdash; "Good,
venerable sir." &mdash; "Blamable or not blamable?"
&mdash; "Not blamable, venerable sir." &mdash; "Censured
or praised by the wise?" &mdash; "Praised, venerable
sir." &mdash; "Undertaken and observed, do these things lead
to benefit and happiness, or not? Or how does it strike you?"
&mdash; "Undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit
and happiness. Thus it strikes us here."</p>

<p>15. "Therefore, did
we say, Kalamas, what was said thus, 'Come Kalamas. Do not go upon
what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor
upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor
upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a

ability; nor upon the consideration, "The monk is our
teacher." Kalamas, when you yourselves know: "These things
are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by
the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and
happiness," enter on and abide in them.'</p>

<p class="subhd">The
Four Exalted Dwellings</p>

<p>16. "The disciple of
the Noble Ones, Kalamas, who in this way is devoid of coveting,
devoid of ill will, undeluded, clearly comprehending and mindful,
dwells, having pervaded, with the thought of amity, one quarter;
likewise the second; likewise the third; likewise the fourth; so
above, below, and across; he dwells, having pervaded because of the
existence in it of all living beings, everywhere, the entire world,
with the great, exalted, boundless thought of amity that is free of
hate or malice.</p>

<p>"He lives, having
pervaded, with the thought of compassion, one quarter; likewise the
second; likewise the third; likewise the fourth; so above, below, and
across; he dwells, having pervaded because of the existence in it of
all living beings, everywhere, the entire world, with the great,
exalted, boundless thought of compassion that is free of hate or malice.</p>

<p>"He lives, having
pervaded, with the thought of gladness, one quarter; likewise the
second; likewise the third; likewise the fourth; so above, below, and
across; he dwells, having pervaded because of the existence in it of
all living beings, everywhere, the entire world, with the great,
exalted, boundless thought of gladness that is free of hate or malice.</p>

<p>"He lives, having
pervaded, with the thought of equanimity, one quarter; likewise the
second; likewise the third; likewise the fourth; so above, below, and
across; he dwells, having pervaded because of the existence in it of
all living beings, everywhere, the entire world, with the great,
exalted, boundless thought of equanimity that is free of hate or malice.</p>

<p class="subhd">The
Four Solaces</p>

<p>17. "The disciple of
the Noble Ones, Kalamas, who has such a hate-free mind, such a
malice-free mind, such an undefiled mind, and such a purified mind,
is one by whom four solaces are found here and now.</p>

<p>"'Suppose there is a
hereafter and there is a fruit, result, of deeds done well or ill.
Then it is possible that at the dissolution of the body after death,
I shall arise in the heavenly world, which is possessed of the state
of bliss.' This is the first solace found by him.</p>

<p>"'Suppose there is
no hereafter and there is no fruit, no result, of deeds done well or
ill. Yet in this world, here and now, free from hatred, free from
malice, safe and sound, and happy, I keep myself.' This is the second
solace found by him.</p>

<p>"'Suppose evil
(results) befall an evil-doer. I, however, think of doing evil to no
one. Then, how can ill (results) affect me who do no evil deed?' This
is the third solace found by him.</p>

<p>"'Suppose evil
(results) do not befall an evil-doer. Then I see myself purified in
any case.' This is the fourth solace found by him.</p>

<p>"The disciple of the
Noble Ones, Kalamas, who has such a hate-free mind, such a
malice-free mind, such an undefiled mind, and such a purified mind,
is one by whom, here and now, these four solaces are found."</p>

<p>"So it is, Blessed
One. So it is, Sublime one. The disciple of the Noble Ones, venerable
sir, who has such a hate-free mind, such a malice-free mind, such an
undefiled mind, and such a purified mind, is one by whom, here and
now, four solaces are found.</p>

<p>"'Suppose there is a
hereafter and there is a fruit, result, of deeds done well or ill.

<p>"Marvelous,
venerable sir! Marvelous, venerable sir! As if, venerable sir, a
person were to turn face upwards what is upside down, or to uncover
the concealed, or to point the way to one who is lost or to carry a
lamp in the darkness, thinking, 'Those who have eyes will see visible
objects,' so has the Dhamma been set forth in many ways by the
Blessed One. We, venerable sir, go to the Blessed One for refuge, to
the Dhamma for refuge, and to the Community of Bhikkhus for refuge.
Venerable sir, may the Blessed One regard us as lay followers who
have gone for refuge for life, from today."</p>
