<p class="hd">The Velaama Sutta</p>

<p class="subhd">A</p>

<p>1. Once, when the
Buddha was dwelling near Saavatthii at Jeta Grove, in
Anaathapi.n.dika's park,
the householder Anaathapi.n.dika visited him, and after greeting him
politely
sat down at one side.</p>

<p>2. The Exalted One
addressed Anaathapi.n.dika: "Are alms given in your house,
householder?"</p>

<p>3. "Yes, Lord, alms
are given by my family, but they only consist of broken rice and sour
gruel."</p>

<p class="subhd">B</p>

<p>4. "Householder, whether one gives
coarse or choice alms, if one gives them without respect, without
thought, not by one's own hand, gives only leftovers, and
without belief in the result of actions, then wherever he is
reborn as a result of his having given these alms, his mind will not
turn to the enjoyment of fine food and clothing, fine vehicles or the
fine objects of the five senses. His children, wife, servants, and
labourers will not obey him, and neither listen nor pay attention to
him. And why is that so? Because this is the result of actions done
without respect.</p>

<p>5. "But whether one
gives coarse or choice alms, if one gives them with respect,
thoughtfully, by
one's own hand, gives things that are not leftovers, and with
belief in the
result of actions, then wherever he is reborn as a result of
his having given
these alms, his mind will turn to the enjoyment of fine food, clothes
and
vehicles, and of the finer objects of the five senses. His children,
wife,
servants, and labourers will obey him, listen and pay attention to him.
And why
is this? Because this is the result of actions done with respect.</p>

<p class="subhd">C</p>

<p>6. "Long ago,
householder, there lived a brahman called Velaama. He gave very
valuable gifts
such as these: He gave eighty-four thousand golden bowls filled with
silver; he
gave eighty-four thousand silver bowls filled with gold; he gave
eighty-four
thousand copper bowls filled with jewels; he gave eighty-four thousand
horses
with trappings, banners and nets of gold; he gave eighty-four thousand
carriages spread with lion skins, tiger skins and leopard skins, with
saffron-coloured blankets, with golden trappings, banners and nets; he
gave
eighty-four thousand milk-giving cows with fine jute ropes and silver
milk
pails; he gave eighty-four thousand bejeweled maidens; he gave
beds with
covers of fleece, white blankets, embroidered coverlets,
covered with antelope
skins, with awnings, and with crimson cushions at the ends; he gave
eighty-four
thousand lengths of cloth of the best flax, silk, wool, and cotton. And
who
could describe all the food both hard and soft kinds, sweets and syrups
that he
gave? They flowed like rivers.</p>

<p>7. "Perhaps,
householder, you think that the brahman Velaama who made that very
valuable
gift was someone else. Do not think that; it was I who was Velaama the
brahman
who made that very valuable gift. </p>

<p class="subhd">D</p>

<p>8. "But when those
alms were given, householder, there were no recipients worthy of the
gift.
Although the brahman Velaama gave such a valuable gift, if he had fed
one
person of right view, the fruit of the latter deed would have
been greater.</p>

<p>9. "Though he gave
that very rich gift, or though he fed a hundred people of right view,
the fruit
of feeding a Once-returner would have been greater.</p>

<p>10. "Though he gave
that very valuable gift, or though he fed a hundred Once-returners, the
fruit
of feeding one Non-returner would have been greater.</p>

<p>11. "... though he fed
a hundred Non-returners, the fruit of feeding one Arahat would have
been
greater. </p>

<p>12. "... though he fed
a hundred Arahats, the fruit of feeding one Non-Teaching Buddha would
have been
greater.</p>

<p>13. "... though he fed
a hundred Non-Teaching Buddhas, the fruit of feeding one Perfect One, a
Teaching Buddha, would have been greater.</p>

<p>14. "... though he
fed one Perfect One, a Teaching Buddha, the fruit of feeding the Order
of monks
(Sa.ngha) with the Buddha at its head would have been greater.<sup><a href="#ftn1" name="ftnref1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>15. "... though he fed
the Order of monks with the Buddha at its head, the fruit of building a
monastery for the use of the monks of the Order of the
surrounding country
would have been greater.</p>

<p class="subhd">E</p>

<p>16. "... though he
built a monastery for the Order, the fruit of sincerely taking refuge
in the
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha would have been greater.</p>

<p>17. "... though he
sincerely took refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, the
fruit of
sincerely undertaking to keep the moral precepts, abstaining
from killing,
stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxicants causing sloth,
would have
been greater.</p>

<p class="subhd">F</p>

<p>18. "... though he
sincerely undertook those precepts, the fruit of developing
concentration on
radiating universal loving-kindness <i>mettaa</i>
even just to the extent of a whiff of scent, would have been greater.</p>

<p class="subhd">G</p>

<p>19. "... though he
developed loving-kindness to the extent of a whiff of scent, the fruit
of
cultivating the thought of impermanence, even for the moment of a
finger snap,
would have been greater."</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<p class="hd">Introduction</p>

<p>In the Velaama
Sutta, the Buddha provides us with a vivid outline of the relative
degrees of
merit that can be acquired by performing different kinds of good
actions (<i>kusala-kamma</i>).
He does not discuss the specific results produced by
meritorious deeds, but
only their relative gradation. While his outline is lightly sketched,
its
implications are extensive and profound.</p>

<p>Good actions are
bodily deeds, spoken words, or thoughts, accompanied by wholesome
volition (<i>kusala-cetanaa</i>). Wholesome
volition may
be rooted in the mental factors of non-greed (or detachment),
non-hatred (or
goodwill), or non-delusion (wisdom). Sections A, B, C, and D
of the Velaama
Sutta deal with bodily good deeds: various kinds of charity,
generosity or
giving, the Triple Refuge, and undertaking the Five Precepts (which are
usually
all included in the Pali word <i>daana</i>).
Section E deals with verbal good deeds: talking done aloud, either
alone or by
repeating them after a monk or teacher. Sections F and G concern purely
mental
good deeds, as both deal with aspects of meditation. Mental actions can
be very
powerful, and the Buddha points out that proper development of
concentration (<i>samaadhi</i>) and wisdom (<i>pa.t.taa</i>) generate the most potent good
results (<i>vipaaka</i>) of all the many
kinds of wholesome kamma. Good kamma brings good future results to the
doer in
accordance with the natural moral law of cause and effect. Likewise,
bad
actions yield bad future results in the form of different
kinds of suffering.
The degree and kind of beneficial result (<i>vipaaka</i>)
or fruit (<i>phala</i>) varies widely with
the kind and
quality of the good kamma or merit (<i>pa.t.taa</i>) that
has been performed.
In the Velaama Sutta the Buddha devotes the greater part of his
exposition to
giving: Sections A, B, C, and D all discuss this most basic kind of
wholesome
deed. Morality (<i>siila</i>) is dealt with in
Section E, concentration (<i>samaadhi</i>)
in Section F, and wisdom or
insight (<i>pa.t.taa, vipassanaa</i>) in Section G. These
are the four major
categories that include all kinds of wholesome kamma. Together they
make up the
Noble Eightfold Path, which is the Buddha's prescription for
putting an end to
suffering.<sup><a href="#ftn2" name="ftnref2">2</a></sup></p>

<div class="line"></div>

<p class="hd">Giving</p>

<p>In the Velaama
Sutta, the Buddha is speaking to his leading lay disciple, the great
donor and
rich merchant of Saavatthii, who was known as
Anaathapi.n.dika. He was already
renowned as a generous giver of charity to the Buddha and his monks (<i>bhikkhus</i>), 
and also
to the poor of the area.</p>

<p>In
Section A, the Buddha asks the layman
whether daana, specifically alms food, is given by his household.
Anaathapi.n.dika replies that such charity is given but it consists of
only
very coarse kinds of food. The commentary explains that he is referring
to the
alms his family gives to the needy who come to their door, not to the
much
finer gifts they customarily donate to the Sangha, the Order of
Buddhist monks.
Another possible explanation for the poor quality of the alms
that
Anaathapi.n.dika mentions is that this conversation took place at a
time when
his vast assets had been greatly diminished through a series
of misfortunes
that drained him of almost all his wealth. At the same time,
because of his
natural compassion, he was reluctant to press his debtors to repay
their debts,
and many took advantage of his kindness. Even during this period of
stringency
for his household, this great benefactor made it a point to give food
to the
monks daily, but he could only afford plain, simple fare, not the rich
curries
and sweets he offered to them during more prosperous times.<sup><a href="#ftn3" name="ftnref3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>If
this second explanation for the poor
alms-food given by Anaathapi.n.dika's family is accepted,
then Section B of the
discourse may be understood as the Buddha's way of reassuring
him that even though
at the moment he could not give sumptuous food, he would still continue
to earn
much merit from his offerings so long as he gave them with the proper
mental
attitude.</p>

<p>The proper approach
to giving and the kammic results it brings form the substance
of Section B of
the Velaama Sutta. The Buddha explains what kind of giving
will bring full
benefit according to the kammic law, and what kind will not. In all its
varieties, daana is always a meritorious action that leads to pleasant
results.
Defined very broadly in the Buddhist texts, daana includes not only the
giving
of material gifts but also the giving of one's time and
energy in voluntary
service and the teaching of the Dhamma. It even includes giving other
beings
freedom from fear by being non-violent oneself.</p>

<p>Whether or not the
gift itself is valuable in monetary terms is irrelevant to the
Buddha's
analysis, as shown by the phrase "whether one gives coarse or
choice alms" at
the beginning of both paragraphs in Section B. In other sermons the
Buddha says
that if the value of a gift is proportionate to the donor's
financial
situation, that is both appropriate and sufficient. A small
gift from a poor
person can create as much good kamma as a large gift from a wealthy
one. A
meager gift from a prince would bring a poor acquisition of good kamma,
while
if a poor man shared the last cup of rice in his house with someone
else, this
could be extremely beneficial.</p>

<p>In the Velaama
Sutta, the Buddha deals first with gifts which will not bring as much
merit as they
would if offered properly (.m 4). A gift of any quality, fancy or
plain, will
give only limited future benefits if it is given casually; without
respect;
thoughtlessly; in an impolite way; by having another person hand it
over; if it
is left over from one's own meal; or if it is given without
considering and
understanding the law of kamma and its fruits ("belief in the
result of
actions" in the words of the sutta). The last is the most
important of the five
factors.</p>

<p>Even if the result
of such a gift puts the donor in a position where, in a subsequent
life, he
receives fine food, clothes and vehicles, lives in comfortable
circumstances
and enjoys good health, the Buddha states that he may not be able to
enjoy
these things. In addition, at this time his children and the people who
work
for him will not listen to him or pay attention to what he
says. The Buddha
declares that this happens because such is the natural kammic result of
actions
performed without respect. In other words, a person who gives in such a
haphazard way will not be able to enjoy or appreciate the pleasant
results
which the act of generosity is bound to bring him.</p>

<p>An example of this
is a certain miser discussed in a series of conversations between King
Pasenadi
of Kosala and the Buddha.<sup><a href="#ftn4" name="ftnref4">4</a></sup>
The king describes a very wealthy man in
Saavatthii who had recently died without making arrangements
for anyone to
inherit his property. Under these circumstances, Kosalan law provided
that the
king was entitled to confiscate the entire fortune; he had just done so
when he
came to see the Buddha. King Pasenadi mentioned all this to the Buddha
because
the dead man had been known to be very miserly, even towards himself.
He lived
as though he were indigent, wearing the roughest kind of clothes,
eating stale
food and using the cheapest kind of carriage.</p>

<p>In reply the Buddha
told King Pasenadi that once, in the distant past, this man had given
food to a
Non-Teaching Buddha but had regretted his deed immediately afterwards,
thinking, "It would have been better if my slaves and workers
had eaten it."
The offering of this gift to such a wise being had led to his rebirth
several
times in the celestial planes, and subsequently as an eminently rich
man in
Saavatthii. However, the unwholesome kamma generated by his subsequent
regret
resulted in his miserly temperament and "inclined
his heart to denying himself
excellent food, clothes, carriages, and enjoyment of sense
pleasures."</p>

<p>In .m 5
of the Velaama Sutta the Buddha tells
Anaathapi.n.dika that if one gives fresh food, considerately, with
one's own
hands, and after thinking about the deed and with belief in kamma and
its
fruit, then wherever that almsgiving brings its fruit in future births,
the
giver's mind will be able to appreciate the sense pleasures
available to him,
and his children, wife and workers will be obedient and cooperative.
This is
the opposite of the result of carelessly performed charity.
Both are good
deeds, but the accompanying states of mind are poles apart,
and this influences
the result.</p>

<p>It is interesting to
note that the Buddha teaches that for ordinary householders,
legitimately
earned pleasures of the senses (attractive sights, sounds, smells,
tastes, or
tangibles) need not be avoided when they do not entail breaking the
Five
Precepts.</p>

<p>Such pleasurable
feelings are simply facts of life, the result of our previous good
deeds. If
they have been earned they might as well be enjoyed; there is no
"sin" involved
as long as the Five Precepts are scrupulously kept.<sup><a href="#ftn5" name="ftnref5">5</a></sup> Being miserly creates even worse kamma than spending
reasonably on oneself and one's dependents. Sharing
one's earned wealth, of
course, is good kamma.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p class="hd"> The
Gifts of Velaama</p>

</div>

<p>In Section C the
Buddha provides a story from the past to illustrate the practice of
generosity.
He describes the incredibly lavish gifts he bestowed in one of
his previous
existences when, as a Bodhisatta developing the perfection of
giving (<i>daana-paaramii</i>), he
was reborn as the brahman Velaama. His gifts included gold and silver,
valuable
domestic animals, fancy chariots and luxurious beds. Velaama also gave
away
food and drink in vast quantities.</p>

<p>The Buddha points
out to Anaathapi.n.dika in Section D that even though
Velaama's generosity was
vast and his gifts were given properly (in accordance with the
guidelines in
Section B), the results were not as complete as they might
have been under
different circumstances. In Velaama's time there
were no beings available who
were, in the most eminent sense, truly worthy to receive his gifts. The
proper
recipient would have been an Ariya, a Noble One, one who had attained
to any of
the four stages of holiness by purifying his mind of defilements. The
Buddha
continues to develop, throughout the rest of this section,
this same theme:
purity of the recipient is an essential factor that influences the
amount of
merit earned by an act of generosity.</p>

<p>A series of verses
in the Dhammapada make a similar point (vv. 106-108). In these stanzas,
it is
said that simply paying sincere respect to Ariyas is far more
meritorious than
making sacrifices, tending ritual fires or giving gifts to
non-Ariyas.
Respectfully giving a gift to an Ariya must be even more profitable
than bowing
to one, although such daana
does not
figure in these lines. </p>

<p>"Whatever gifts
and oblations one seeking merit might offer in this world for a whole
year, all
that is not worth one fourth of the merit gained by revering the
Upright Ones
Ariyas, which is truly excellent." </p>

<p>(Dhp
108)</p>

<p>While the Buddha was
alive, and for as long as his teachings are practiced, individuals of
great
purity arise in the world, and gifts to them bring the
greatest merit that can
be earned through generosity. Although it may be hard to find Ariyas
today,
people who keep the moral precepts (<i>siila</i>), practise
concentration (<i>samaadhi</i>),
and cultivate wisdom (<i>pa.t.taa</i>)
are certainly available.
Such individuals, whether monks or laypeople, share to some extent in
the
characteristics of Ariyas. For this reason, gifts to them
should bear greater
fruit than gifts to ordinary folk who make no effort to improve
themselves.
Wandering ascetics as well as priests may or may not live
morally, and they
may or may not strive to develop concentration and wisdom.
Hence it is
uncertain whether such recipients will endow a gift with the maximum of
profit
for the donor.</p>

<p>From Section D
through the rest of the sutta the Buddha describes a scale or hierarchy
of
meritorious deeds. This scale of merit begins with Velaama's
gifts as the broad
base, and then ascends by degrees culminating in the wisdom
that knows the
truth of impermanence (<i>anicca</i>).</p>

<p>Above the greatest
gift given to non-Ariyas comes feeding different categories of Ariyas.
Giving
nourishment to beings with such pure minds is a very
valuable source of
merit. In .m 8 the Buddha says that the fruit of feeding a single
person of
right view would be greater than the fruit of Velaama's vast
generosity given
to ordinary worldlings. A person of right view is the first kind of
Ariya, a
Stream-enterer (<i>sotaapanna</i>),
one
assured of liberation in a maximum of seven lifetimes. A Stream-enterer
keeps
the Five Precepts perfectly; possesses full faith in the
Buddha, Dhamma and
Sangha; has thoroughly understood that everything comes about as a
result of
causes and conditions; and has thereby eliminated three
defilements from his
mental continuum.</p>

<p>These three
defilements are the incorrect view that affirms a lasting self or soul,
all
doubt about the way to liberation, and the belief that rites and
rituals can
lead to liberation. It is eliminating belief in a self that gives the
Stream-enterer the title "one of right view."</p>

<p>The Buddha goes
through the remaining three higher kinds of Ariya in order: the
Once-returner (<i>sakadaagaami</i>), who
has greatly
attenuated sense desire and ill will; the Non-returner (<i>anaagaami</i>),
who has totally uprooted these two defilements; and
the fully liberated Arahat, who has eradicated all traces of greed,
hatred and
ignorance and all other mental impurities. The Buddha states that
feeding one
of each higher stage brings greater rewards than feeding a hundred on
the stage
just below.</p>

<p>The greatest
recipients, named next, are Buddhas, who are beings that attain
liberation
unaided (by discovering the ultimate truths about existence for
themselves
without the guidance of a teacher). There are two kinds of Buddhas:
Non-Teaching Buddhas (<i>paccekabuddha</i>)
and universal Buddhas who instruct other beings (<i>sammaa-sambuddha</i>),
like Gotama Buddha. Any number of Paccekabuddhas
can exist at one time in the world, but they only arise during periods
when
there is no Samma-sambuddha living, and when the teachings of one are
not
available, that is, when no Buddha <i>Saasana</i>
is extant. However, there
can only be one Sammaa-sambuddha at a time. The Buddha declares that
because of
his superior stature, feeding a Sammaa-sambuddha brings greater results
than
feeding a hundred Paccekabuddhas. However, the act of daana
that is the most
beneficial of all is not a gift of food but constructing a monastery
for the
use of the Sangha with the Buddha at its head.</p>

<p>During his life, Anaathapi.n.dika
performed virtually all the acts of generosity named in the sutta.
Shortly
after his first encounter with the Buddha he purchased a park
known as Jeta
Grove (Jetavana) and had a large monastery built there. He then donated
the
property to the Buddha and the community of monks. Anaathapi.n.dika
always gave
alms-food, robes and medicine to the monks who came to stay at
Jetavana. Among
those bhikkhus were the greatest Arahat disciples of the
Buddha as well as
numerous other Noble Ones.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<p class="hd">Morality: The Refuges and Precepts</p>

<p>The hierarchy of
merit generated by different forms of good kamma continues beyond
generosity
and culminates in the final three sections of the Velaama Sutta: E, F
and G.
Even greater than the fruit of Velaama's gifts, or of feeding
any kind and
number of Noble Ones, or of building a monastery for the Order, is the
merit
earned from sincerely going for refuge to the Triple Gem (the first
step taken
by anyone who considers himself a Buddhist Section E).</p>

<p>The value of going
for refuge to the Awakened One, to the Truth embodied in his Teaching,
and to
the community of those who are following his Teaching (the
Buddha, the Dhamma
and the Sangha) can be vast if it is accompanied by full comprehension:
</p>

<p>"He who has gone
for refuge to the Buddha, his Teaching and his Order penetrates with
wisdom the
Four Noble Truths: suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation of
suffering, and the Noble Eightfold Path leading to the cessation of
suffering" </p>

<p>(Dhp
190-91) </p>

<p>This means that
going for refuge with understanding can result in penetration
of the Four
Noble Truths. If one considers the Buddha and Dhamma as
one's protection, one
will naturally try to follow those teachings, and practice the
way to the
utter cessation of suffering, which the Buddha devoted his life to
explaining.
One will try to comprehend the first noble truth, eliminate the second
truth by
developing the fourth truth (the path) until the third noble
truth has been
realized.</p>

<p>By taking refuge one
enters the way to liberation shown by the Buddha. Giving can be
practiced even
during the vast periods of cosmic history when no Buddha Saasana is
available,
as Velaama's story illustrates. Charity is, after
all, central to virtually
every religion, to every code of good conduct; it is not exclusively
Buddhist.
But obviously, one can only take the Triple Refuge while the
Buddha-Dhamma is
available; at other times the Refuges would be inaccessible.</p>

<p>The Velaama Sutta's
elisions in .m17 leave some doubt about the exact relationship between
going
for refuge and keeping the precepts (<i>siila</i>)
in the hierarchy of meritorious deeds. Although I have remained close
to Hare's
translation in my rendering, Hecker says that taking the Triple Refuge
"would
be perfected if one observed the Five Precepts."<sup><a href="#ftn6" name="ftnref6">6</a></sup> The Venerable &Ntilde;aa.namoli's
translation combines the two in a
slightly different way: "Yet it is still more fruitful to go
with a confident
heart for refuge to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha and undertake the
Five
Precepts of virtue."<sup><a href="#ftn7" name="ftnref7">7</a></sup>
The Refuges and the Precepts are closely
connected steps of basic Buddhist practice; so regardless of
the rendering, we
can be confident that the undertaking of the Five Precepts here is
additional
to, rather than a replacement for, the going for refuge.</p>

<p>The Five Precepts,
the minimum moral requirement for a Buddhist layman, consist of
abstaining from
doing things that would hurt others, from deeds that lead to
one's own rebirth
in the lower realms where there is unremitting and intense suffering.
To undertake
the Five Precepts, one declares: "I will refrain from
killing, stealing, sexual
misconduct, lying and the use of intoxicants," and then
observes them to the
best of one's ability. Taking the Refuges when
one's morality is pure combines
two valuable actions which can produce abundant long-term fruits.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<p class="hd">Concentration and Lovingkindness</p>

<p>But greater still
than mere morality is the merit earned from proper meditation, and it
is
meditation or "mental development" (<i>bhaavanaa</i>)
that comprises the highest two rungs in
the Buddha's ladder of meritorious actions. These
rungs are referred to in the
concluding sections (F and G) of the Velaama Sutta. Concentration
obtained by
extending universal loving-kindness (<i>mettaabhaavanaa</i>),
even briefly, is of greater
benefit than keeping the precepts; but without the base of perfect
morality
such meditation would be impossible. The sutta indicates the short span
of
mettaa needed to give results greater than those accruing from keeping
the
precepts with the phrase "a whiff of scent." In the
commentary, an analogy is
used: for only as long as it takes someone milking a cow to give one
pull on
her teat. Both images suggest a brief moment. So valuable is
the practice of
mettaa that even this slight development of it, done properly, brings
the
practitioner a vast amount of merit.</p>

<p>In a discourse in
the Kindred Sayings the Buddha points out, in a similar manner, that
such a
brief radiation of mettaa is kammically far more rewarding
than giving a large
gift:</p>

<p>If anyone,
brethren, were to give a morning gift of a hundred coins, and the same
at noon
and the same in the evening, or if anyone were to practise in the
morning, at
noon or in the evening a heart of love <i>mettaa</i>, even if it were as
slight as one pull at a cow's udder, this practice would be
by far the more
fruitful of the two.</p>

<p>(<i>Kindred
Sayings</i>, II, pp. 176-77) </p>

<p>Concentration
practised to the highest level issues in the <i>jhaanas</i>,
the meditative absorptions. Jhaana
is one-pointed, alert absorption in the object. All sensory
input is cut off and the mind, "secluded from sense
pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states," dwells exclusively fixed upon its chosen
object, free from
extraneous thoughts. But by itself jhaana can lead only to mundane
benefits,
such as peace and bliss in the present life and an exalted rebirth in
the lofty
planes of the Brahma-world, where life endures for extremely long
periods of
time. It does not necessarily lead to liberation.</p>

<p>Concentration on mettaa is a
highly effective means to attain
jhaana, and is also one of the most potent sources of wholesome kamma.
In fact,
among all purely mundane types of merit, the Buddha praises the
meditation on mettaa
as supreme (in a passage which also
underscores its inherent limitations):</p>

<p>Bhikkhus,
whatever kinds of merit there are, undertaken with a view to
rebirth, all of
them are not worth one sixteenth part of the heart's
release of
loving-kindness; in shining and beaming and radiance the
heart's release of
loving-kindness far excels them.<sup><a href="#ftn8" name="ftnref8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>"Heart's release of
loving-kindness" refers to the temporary suppression of
mental defilements by
concentration on mettaa.
"With a view
to rebirth" means aiming at a happy or pleasant rebirth as a
result of the
merit earned by good kamma.</p>

<p>But all rebirth
keeps the round of suffering (<i>dukkha</i>) rolling on,
and the Buddha's unique
teaching aims at permanently eliminating all suffering.
Repeated existence is
ultimately and inevitably suffering. All beings who are born
must grow old,
suffer from disease, and eventually die. Even Brahmas, who enjoy
exceedingly
long and blissful lives as the fruits of cultivating the jhaanas, will
die and
be reborn in other planes of existence, over and over again. Sa.msaara, for all beings, is an
ever-repeated process of birth and death, involving suffering, pain,
insecurity, and impermanence. Only wisdom can enable us to break out of
this
vicious cycle. Concentration alone, for all its ability to bring
pleasant
results, cannot cut the sequence of birth, death and rebirth.
Concentration
that does not lead to insight in the long run only perpetuates
suffering by
providing yet more fuel for rebirth. For this reason, the Buddha tells
Anaathapi.n.dika (in Section G of the sutta) that the thought of
impermanence,
which is one aspect of wisdom, creates the greatest good kamma of all
meritorious actions.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<p class="hd">Wisdom: &nbsp;Insight into Impermanence</p>

<p>If Velaama had been
able to meditate directly on impermanence (<i>anicca</i>)
in his mind or body just for the span of a finger-snap, it would have
brought
him greater fruit than all the other good deeds mentioned in all the
preceding
paragraphs of the sutta. But such wisdom was lost to the world in
Velaama's
time, as he lived during the empty aeons between the arising of two
Buddhas.
Therefore he had no access to such understanding.</p>

<p>Why is knowing
impermanence for oneself of such consummate value? In other discourses
that
deal specifically with cultivating insight into impermanence
the Buddha
provides several answers.</p>

<p>First, contemplating
impermanence brings the meditator happiness greater than all
worldly pleasure
because he realizes that with such contemplation he is now moving
towards the
cessation of all suffering. </p>

<p>"Whenever with
insight he sees </p>

<p>the rise and fall of
the aggregates, </p>

<p>he experiences joy
and happiness. </p>

<p>To the discerning one
this reflects the Deathless.</p>

<p>(Dhp
374)</p>

<p>Seeing
"the rise and fall of the aggregates" is
meditating on the transient (<i>anicca</i>)
nature of all the components of the personality. Such insight brings
detachment
from these insubstantial phenomena. Great joy arises in the mind thus
freed of
desire and aversion. The meditator realizes that when his mind becomes
utterly
and permanently liberated from these defilements, Nibbaana will be
attained.</p>

<p>The
second reason for the great value of knowing impermanence is that this
insight
enables one to develop the Noble Eightfold Path all the way to
its ultimate
goal: the cessation of suffering. In one discourse in the
Gradual Sayings, the
Buddha describes six benefits of developing insight into impermanence
which
convince a monk or meditator that he should cultivate this practice to
perfection:</p>

<p>When a monk sees
six rewards it should be enough for him to establish without reserve
the
thought of impermanence in all phenomena. What six?</p>

<p>(1) All
phenomena will seem to me insubstantial;</p>

<p>(2) my mind will
find no relish in all the world; </p>

<p>(3) my mind will
emerge from all the world; </p>

<p>(4) my mind will
incline towards extinction;</p>

<p>(5) my fetters
will come to be abandoned; and </p>

<p>(6) I shall be
endowed with the supreme state of a recluse.<sup><a href="#ftn9" name="ftnref9">9</a></sup></p>

<p>The first reward
leads the meditator to understand the other two characteristics common
to all
phenomena: dukkha (unsatisfactoriness), and <i>anattaa</i>
(essencelessness).
Phenomena are all compounded and conditioned formations (<i>sa.nkhaara</i>)
and the meditator dwelling on impermanence sees that
everything within and around him is conditioned by other
things, all of which
are unstable. As he sees that all the causes are impermanent, he comes
to
realize that the resulting phenomena must likewise be
transient and so without
lasting substance, (insubstantial). That which is impermanent and
without
substance cannot be said to have a lasting essence, so it is not self (<i>anattaa</i>). That which is unstable cannot
be a source of lasting happiness, so it is unsatisfactory (<i>dukkha</i>).</p>

<p>The second reward is
the undermining of <i>ta.nhaa</i> (craving), which by
relishing and delighting
in mundane things of all sorts keeps the mind bound to the round of
rebirth in
a perpetual search for pleasure and self-perpetuation. Where there is
no
craving for sense objects, one fears the risk of involvement with them
and so
develops detachment and disgust towards sensual delights. This leads to
the
third reward: when the mind seeks an alternative to the misery of
impermanent
existence, it tends to disengage itself from everything mundane and so
to break
away from all the world. The fourth reward of knowing
impermanence is the
converse of the third: the mind with no interest in worldly matters
turns
towards the supramundane, the unconditioned (Nibbaana).</p>

<p>The
fifth reward is the destruction of the
fetters which bind beings to the round of rebirth, <i>sa.msaara</i>.
The ten
fetters (<i>sa.myojanaa</i>) are
personality
belief, skeptical doubt, clinging to rites and rituals, craving for
sense
pleasures, ill-will, craving for existence in the fine material planes,
craving
for existence in the immaterial planes, conceit, restlessness, and
ignorance.
Knowledge of impermanence can in time eliminate all these
mental defilements
through the four stages of enlightenment.</p>

<p>The sixth reward
refers to Arahatship, the culmination of the other five. This
is the state of
perfect purity in which no defiling tendencies remain and all
possibility of
future rebirth has been cut off.</p>

<p>In this way,
understanding fully how everything that makes up oneself, and the
external
world, is utterly unstable, can lift the mind to a level of
complete and
permanent purity. This is the prime reason why, in the final paragraph
of the
Velaama Sutta, the Buddha declares that the fruit of even a
moment's insight
into impermanence brings the greatest of all kammic results. Every
moment spent
knowing impermanence through insight brings one closer to the
goal of total
liberation.</p>

<p>In a discourse in
the Kindred Sayings,
the Buddha
explains how consistently and deeply knowing anicca in insight
meditation (<i>vipassanaa</i>)
can lead all the way to Arahatship.</p>

<p>"Perceiving
impermanence, bhikkhus, developed and frequently practised, removes all
sensual
desire, removes all desire for material existence, removes all
desire for
becoming, removes all ignorance, and tears out all conceit of
'I am.'" </p>

<p>(<i>Kindred
Sayings</i>,
III, p. 132) </p>

<p>Developing the
understanding of anicca gradually eliminates every trace of craving,
desire,
aversion, and attachment; for as the meditator comes to realize the
transience
of all aspects of life, he finds sense objects and all prospects of
rebirth
profoundly unsatisfactory, (<i>dukkha</i>). One who has
eliminated the craving for sense pleasures is a
Non-returner (<i>anaagaami</i>), who will never be reborn
in the sensuous
realms of existence, among humans or devas, since his mind no longer
has the
slightest interest in the sense objects which characterize
these realms.
Non-returners generally take birth in the Pure Abodes, the highest
planes of
the fine-material world, which are reserved for such great beings.
Attaining
the stage of Non-returner and rebirth in the Pure Abodes are
among the
blessings that come from profound insight into impermanence.</p>

<p>Non-returners attain
Arahatship by developing further the perception of impermanence in
order to
remove attraction towards life even in the exalted planes of existence.
This
corresponds to the other two kinds of desire mentioned in the
quotation: desire
for material existence and desire for becoming. Simultaneously, every
trace of
ignorance is eradicated and every remnant of the deluding conceit
"I am" is
ripped out of the mind. This is the highest good, the ultimate goal of
the
Buddha's teaching (Arahatship), the living experience of
Nibbaana. This total
cessation of suffering can come about through perfect
understanding of anicca.</p>

<p>How can the insight
into impermanence eliminate conceit (<i>maana</i>)?
When the transience of everything we habitually cling to as
"I" and "me" is
clearly and repeatedly understood, the actual essencelessness (<i>anattaa</i>)
of the supposed "self" becomes perfectly apparent.
Thus, fully developed
insight into impermanence brings the great benefit of insight
into
essencelessness, and full comprehension of essencelessness
brings liberation. </p>

<p>For a monk,
Meghiya, who thinks on impermanence, the thought of not-self
anattaa
endures; thinking on there being no self, he wins to the state wherein
the
conceit 'I am' has been uprooted, to the
cool Nibbaana, even in this life. </p>

<p>(<i>Gradual Sayings</i>,
IV, p. 237)</p>

<p>Without completely
and continually understanding that there is no essence, core or self
anywhere
for anyone, liberation from the round of existence is impossible. As
the Buddha
told Meghiya, an effective way to come to comprehend the truth of
not-self is
through knowing the truth of impermanence. This is because it is easier
to
recognize impermanence on an intellectual level and also easier to
experience
it for oneself in insight meditation.</p>

<p>This knowing of
impermanence is so potent that cultivating it even for a short moment
gives the
greatest results among all the types of meritorious action. All the
other types
of good kamma mentioned by the Buddha in the Velaama Sutta may or may
not be
associated with liberating wisdom. But knowing impermanence is itself
an aspect
of wisdom or insight, and such wisdom, by its very nature,
gradually
eliminates ignorance. True insight must tend towards detachment and
ultimately
towards Nibbaana, the absolute peace that comes with the
ending of all the
causes of suffering.</p>

<p>Now that we have
seen why insight into anicca is of such profound value, it will become
clear
that its results must transcend those of all other kinds of good kamma.
Good
actions not rooted in wisdom will bear fruit in pleasant existences
accompanied
by sense pleasures in the human and celestial planes, as the Buddha
mentioned
in Section B of the Velaama Sutta. Generosity in all its forms, taking
the
Triple Refuge, keeping the Five Precepts, and even developing
the lower levels
of concentration may be all done without wisdom. If they are performed
in such
a way they serve to perpetuate the round of rebirth. If they are
accompanied by
wisdom consciously aimed at Nibbaana, they will tend towards liberation
from
the round. The jhaanas (meditative absorptions) are always associated
with a
degree of wisdom, but this wisdom does not constitute the kind of
insight that
leads out of sa.msaara. Only if the meditator, upon emerging from a
jhaana,
examines that state of mind and sees it as impermanent, unsatisfactory,
and
essenceless (<i>anicca, dukkha,
anattaa</i>),
will the jhaana tend towards release from all suffering.</p>

<p>To illustrate: If
gifts are given with the sole aim of obtaining pleasure in the
celestial
planes, that aim may come to fulfillment, but its fulfillment merely
keeps the
donor revolving in sa.msaara.
Though
he may live pleasantly (in relative comfort) as long as his merit bears
fruit,
when that fruit has been exhausted (as it must sooner or later) he is
bound to
fall again into the lower realms; he may even be reborn into the hells
of the
most intense suffering. This is because everyone has a backlog of
unwholesome
kamma awaiting an opportunity to bear fruit. So many of the volitional
actions
of body, speech and thought that we perform now are also unwholesome (<i>akusala</i>),
as they are associated
with some degree of greed, hatred or delusion; and unwholesome kamma
will cause
painful rebirths.</p>

<p>By contrast,
cultivating insight into impermanence, suffering and essencelessness
leads one
out of the round of rebirth towards liberation from all
suffering. Deep
understanding of the ultimate impermanence of all existence
creates a kind of
kamma whose tendency is to eliminate all past kamma, good and bad, and
so makes
liberation possible (as we have already seen). Such insight works
towards the
state where no more kamma will be created at all:</p>

<p>And what Pu.n.na
... is the kamma that conduces to the destruction of kamma? Where,
Pu.n.na,
there is the volition to get rid of unwholesome kamma, wholesome kamma
and
mixed kamma ... this Pu.n.na is called ... the kamma that conduces
to the
destruction of kamma.</p>

<p>(<i>Middle
Length Sayings, </i>II, p.
58) </p>

<p>The Arahat makes no
new kamma: his mind is free of the ignorance that underlies the
unenlightened
mind, so his thoughts and intentions are merely functional and do not
bring any
kammic results.</p>

<p>Giving, taking the
Triple Refuge, keeping the Five Precepts, and practising concentration,
all
have essential roles to play in maturing one's spiritual
faculties so that one
can cultivate the understanding of the true nature of existence: the
marks of
impermanence, suffering, and non-self. The earlier stages
cannot be dispensed
with: the Buddha taught that morality is to be constantly observed and
concentration to be continually strengthened. Otherwise any
apparent "insight"
that arises will not be pure and deep enough to bring about the
cessation of
craving. Only when insight has a solid base of merit will it be
powerful enough
to penetrate the thick murk of ignorance that keeps us thinking
"I am
permanent" or "I am real."</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<p class="hd">
Conclusion</p>

<p>As a devoted lay
Buddhist, Anaathapi.n.dika was well known for his generosity; the name
by which
he is known to us is actually an epithet meaning "one who
gives alms to the
unprotected," to the poor. He gave open-handedly to all
beings and especially
to the Buddha and his monks. Anaathapi.n.dika had firm confidence in
the
enlightenment of the Buddha, in the truth of the Dhamma he taught, and
in the
purity of the Sangha. Thus he sincerely took refuge in the Triple Gem.
He also
kept the Five Precepts at all times, so his morality was excellent.</p>

<p>In
the Velaama Sutta the Buddha may be indirectly telling Anaathapi.n.dika
that he
should not lose sight of the ultimate goal through his devotion to the
endless
possibilities of mundane good deeds, since these can only bring
mundane,
temporary results. He is reminding the lay follower that the
meditation on
loving-kindness for cultivating concentration, and the meditation on
impermanence for cultivating insight, are by far the greatest sources
of
profound merit. By showing Anaathapi.n.dika this ladder of good deeds,
the
Teacher may have been urging the layman at this stage of his life to
devote
more effort to mental purification.</p>

<p>Giving gifts, taking
the Refuges, and keeping the Precepts are essential to build the
foundation of
good kamma. But the way out of the misery of the round of repeated
births is to
develop a mind sufficiently concentrated to penetrate the ultimate
truth. It is
by fully comprehending the impermanent, unsatisfactory and
essenceless nature
of all things in all the planes of conditioned existence that the final
goal,
the Deathless, is to be won. </p>

day of life perceiving how things rise and fall than to live a century
without
ever perceiving their rise and fall." (Dhp

Perception of Impermanence</p>

<p>At Saavatthii the
Blessed One said:</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, when the
perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated, it eliminates
all
sensual lust, it eliminates all attachment to material form, it
eliminates all
ignorance, it uproots all conceit of 'I am'.</p>

<p>"Just as, bhikkhus,
in the autumn a ploughman ploughing with a great ploughshare cuts
through all
the network of roots as he ploughs, so too when the perception of
impermanence
is developed and cultivated, it eliminates all sensual lust ... it uproots
all conceit of 'I am'.</p>

<p>"Just as a cutter of
reeds would cut down a reed, grab it by its top, and shake it down, and
shake
it out, and thump it about, so too when the perception of impermanence
is
developed and cultivated, it eliminates all sensual lust ...
it uproots all
conceit of 'I am'.</p>

<p>"Just as, when the
stalk of a bunch of mangoes has been cut, all the mangoes attached to
the stalk
follow along with it, so too when the perception of
impermanence is developed
and cultivated, it eliminates all sensual lust ... it
uproots all conceit of
'I am'.</p>

<p>"Just as all the
rafters of a peaked house lead to the roof peak, slope towards the roof
peak
and converge upon the roof peak, and the roof peak is declared to be
their
chief, so too when the perception of impermanence is developed and
cultivated,
it eliminates all sensual lust ... it uproots all conceit of
'I am'.</p>

<p>"Just as, of all
fragrant roots, black fragrant anusari is declared to be their chief,
so too
when the perception of impermanence is developed and
cultivated, it eliminates
all sensual lust ... it uproots all conceit of 'I
am'.</p>

<p>"Just as, of all
fragrant heartwoods, red sandalwood is declared to be their
chief, so too when
the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated, it
eliminates all
sensual lust ... it uproots all conceit of 'I am'.</p>

<p>"Just as, of all
fragrant flowers, the jasmine is declared to be their chief,
so too when the
perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated, it
eliminates all
sensual lust ... it uproots all conceit of 'I am'.</p>

<p>"Just as all petty
princes are the vassals of a Wheel-turning Monarch and the
Wheel-turning
Monarch is declared to be their chief, so too when the perception of
impermanence is developed and cultivated, it eliminates all sensual
lust ...
it uproots all conceit of 'I am'.</p>

<p>"Just as the
radiance of all the stars does not amount to a sixteenth part of the
radiance
of the moon, and the radiance of the moon is declared to be their
chief, so too
when the perception of impermanence is developed and
cultivated, it eliminates
all sensual lust ... it uproots all conceit of 'I
am'.</p>

<p>"Just as, in the
autumn, when the sky is clear and cloudless, the sun rises above the
earth
dispelling all darkness from space as it shines and beams and
radiates, so too
when the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated, it
eliminates
all sensual lust, it eliminates all attachment to material form, it
eliminates
all attachment to being, it eliminates all ignorance, it uproots all
conceit of
'I am'.</p>

<p>"And how, bhikkhus,
is the perception of impermanence developed and cultivated so
that it
eliminates all sensual lust ... and uproots all conceit of
'I am'?</p>

<p>"'Such is material
form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling, such its
origin,
such its passing away; such is perception, such its origin, such its
passing
away; such are mental formations, such their origin, such their passing

such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passing
