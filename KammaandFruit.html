<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Introduction: Kamma and Its Fruit</a></p>

<p><i>Kamma&mdash;or,
</i>in its Sanskrit form, <i>karma&mdash;is </i>the
Buddhist conception of action as a force which shapes and transforms
human destiny. Often misunderstood as an occult power or as an
inescapable fate, kamma as taught by the Buddha is in actuality nothing
other than our own will or volition coming to expression in concrete
action. The Buddhist doctrine of kamma thus places ultimate
responsibility for human destiny in our own hands. It reveals to us how
our ethical choices and actions can become either a cause of pain and
bondage or a means to spiritual freedom.</p>

<p>In
this book, five practising Buddhists, all with modern
backgrounds, offer their reflections on the significance of kamma and
its relations to ethics, spiritual practice, and philosophical
understanding.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="Action"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Action</a></p>

<p class="author">Francis Story</p>

<p>Kamma
is simply action, a "deed." Actions are
performed in three ways: by body, mind and speech. Every action of
importance is performed <i>because there is desire for a result;
</i>it
has an aim, an objective. One wishes for something specific to happen
as the result of it. This desire, no matter how mild it may be, is a
form of craving. It expresses the thirst <i>(ta.nhaa) </i>for
existence and for action. To exist is to act, on one level or another.
Organic existence consists of chemical action; psychic existence
consists of mental action. So existence and action are inseparable.</p>

<p>But
some actions, those in which mind is involved, are bound to have
intention. This is expressed by the Pali word <i>cetanaa</i>,
volition, which is one of the mental properties. There is another word,
<i>chanda, </i>which
stands for wishing, desiring a result. These words all express some
kind of desire. And some form of desire is behind practically every
activity of life. Therefore "to live" and "to desire" are one and the
same thing. (There is one ultimate exception to this statement, which
we shall come to later. It is that of the Arahat.)</p>

<p>An
action (kamma) is morally unwholesome when it is
motivated by the forms of craving that are associated with greed,
hatred and delusion <i>(lobha, dosa,</i> <i>moha). </i>It
is morally
wholesome (in ordinary language, good) when it is motivated by the
opposite factors, disinterestedness (greedlessness), amity and wisdom.
An act so motivated is prompted by "intention" rather than "craving."
Yet in every act of craving, intention is included. It is that which
gives direction and form to the deed.</p>

<p>Now,
each deed performed with intention is a <i>creative act. </i>By
reason of the will behind it, it constitutes a force. It is a force
analogous to the other great unseen, yet physical, forces that move the
universe. By our thoughts, words and deeds we create our world from
moment to moment in the endless process of change. We also create our
"selves." That is to say, we mould our changing personality as we go
along by the accumulation of such thoughts, words and deeds. It is the
accretion of these, and the preponderance of one kind over another,
that determines what we shall become, in this life and in subsequent
ones.</p>

<p>In
thus creating our personality, we create also the
conditions in which it functions. In other words, we create also the
kind of world we are to live in. The mind, therefore, is master of the
world. As a man'<i>s</i> mind is, so is his
cosmos.</p>

<p>Kamma,
then, as the product of the mind, is the true
and only real force in the life-continuum, the flux of coming-to-be.
From this we come to understand that it is the residue of mental force
which from the point of death kindles a new birth. It is the only
actual link between one life ("reincarnation") and another. And since
the process is a continuous one, it is the last kammic thought-moment
at the point of death that forms the rebirth-linking
consciousness&mdash;the kamma that reproduces. Other kamma, good or
bad, will
come into operation at some later stage, when external conditions are
favourable for its ripening. The force of weak kamma may be suspended
for a long time by the interposition of a stronger kamma. Some kinds of
kamma may even be inoperative; but this never happens with very strong
or weighty kamma. As a general principle, all kamma bears some kind of
fruit sooner or later.</p>

<p>Each
individual's kamma is his own personal act, its
results his own personal inheritance. He alone has complete command
over his actions, no matter to what degree others may try to force him.
Yet an unwholesome deed done under strong compulsion does not have
quite the same force as one performed voluntarily. Under threat of
torture or of death a man may be compelled to torture or kill someone
else. In such a case it may be believed that the gravity of his kamma
is not so severe as it would be had he deliberately chosen to act in
such a way. The heaviest moral responsibility rests with those who have
forced him to the action. But in the ultimate sense he still must bear
some responsibility, for he could in the most extreme case avoid
harming another by choosing to suffer torture or death himself.</p>

<p>This
brings us to the question of <i>collective kamma. </i>As
we have seen, each man's kamma is his own individual
experience. No one
can interfere with the kamma of another beyond a certain point;
therefore no one can intervene to alter the results of personal kamma.
Yet it often happens that numbers of people are associated in the same
kind of actions, and share the same kind of thoughts; they become
closely involved with one another; they influence one another. Mass
psychology produces mass kamma. Therefore all such people are likely to
form the same pattern of kamma. It may result in their being associated
with one another through a number of lives, and in their sharing much
the same kind of experiences. "Collective kamma" is simply the
aggregate of individual kammas, just as a crowd is an aggregate of
individuals.</p>

<p>It
is in fact this kind of mass kamma that produces
different kinds of worlds&mdash;the world we live in, the states of
greater
suffering and the states of relative happiness. Each being inhabits the
kind of cosmic construction for which he has fitted himself. It is his
kamma, and the kamma of beings like himself, that has created it. This
is how it comes about that in multidimensional space-time there are
many <i>lokas</i>&mdash;many worlds and modes of
being. Each one represents
a particular type of consciousness, the result of kamma. The mind is
confined only by the boundaries it erects itself.</p>

<p>The
results of kamma are called <i>vipaaka</i>, "the
ripening." These terms, <i>kamma </i>and <i>vipaaka</i>,
and the ideas they stand for, must not be confused. Vipaaka is
predetermined (by ourselves) by previous kamma. But kamma itself in the
ultimate sense (that is, when resisting all external pressures and
built-up tendencies) is the product of <i>choice </i>and
free will:
between wholesome and unwholesome deeds, good or bad actions. Hence the
Buddha said: "Intention constitutes kamma." Without intention a deed is
sterile; it produces no reaction of moral significance. One
reservation, however, is here required; if a deed done in "culpable
negligence" proves harmful to
others, the lack of mindfulness, circumspection or consideration shown
will constitute unwholesome kamma and will have its vipaaka. Though the
harm done was not "intended," i.e. the deed was not motivated by hate,
yet there was present another "unwholesome root," delusion <i>(moha),
</i>which includes, for instance, irresponsible
thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>Kamma
is action; vipaaka is result. Therefore kamma
is the active principle; vipaaka is the passive mode of coming-to-be.
People believe in predeterminism, fatalism, merely because they see
results, but do not see causes. In the process of dependent origination
<i>(pa.ticca-samuppaada) </i>both causes and effects
are shown in their proper relationship.</p>

<p>A
person may be born deaf, dumb and blind. That is
the consequence of some unwholesome kamma which manifested or presented
itself to his consciousness in the last thought-moment of his previous
death. Throughout life he may have to suffer the consequences (vipaaka)
of that deed, whatever it may have been. But that fact does not prevent
him from forming fresh kamma of a wholesome type to restore the balance
in his next life. Furthermore, by the aid of some good kamma from the
past, together with strong effort and favourable circumstances in the
present life (which of course includes the compassionate help of
others), the full effects of his bad kamma may be mitigated even here
and now.</p>

<p>Cases
of this kind are seen everywhere, where people
have overcome to a great extent the most formidable handicaps. The
result is that they have turned even the bad vipaaka to profit for
themselves and others. One outstanding example of this is the famous
Dr. Helen Keller. But this calls for almost superhuman courage and
will-power. Most people in similar circumstances remain passive
sufferers of the effects of their bad deeds until those effects are
exhausted. Thus it has to be in the case of those born mentally
defective or in the lower states of suffering. Having scarcely any
capacity for the exercise of free will, they are subject entirely to
predeterminism until the bad vipaaka has run its course.</p>

<p>So,
by acknowledging some element of predeterminism, yet at the same time
maintaining the <i>ultimate</i>
ascendancy of will, Buddhism resolves a moral problem which otherwise
seems insoluble. Part of the personality, and the conditions in which
it exists, are predetermined by the deeds and the total personality of
the past; but in the final analysis the mind is able to free itself
from the bondage of past personality-construction and launch out in a
fresh direction.</p>

<p>Now,
we have seen that the three roots of
unwholesome actions&mdash;greed, hatred and
delusion&mdash;produce bad results; the
three roots of wholesome actions&mdash;disinterestedness, amity and
wisdom&mdash;produce good results. Actions which are performed
automatically
or unconsciously, or are incidental to some other action having an
entirely different objective, do not produce results beyond their
immediate mechanical consequences. If one treads on an insect in the
dark one is not morally responsible for its death. One has been merely
an unconscious instrument of the insect's own kamma in
producing its
death.</p>

<p>But
while there is a large class of actions of the
last type, which cannot be avoided, the more important actions in
everyone's life are dominated by one or other of these six
psychological roots, wholesome and unwholesome. Even where a life is
physically inactive, the thoughts are at work; they are producing
kamma. Cultivation of the mind therefore consists in removing (not
suppressing) unwholesome mental states and substituting wholesome ones.
Modern civilisation develops by suppressing unwholesome (the
"anti-social") instincts. Consequently they break out from time to time
in unwholesome eruptions. A war breaks out and the homicidal maniac
comes into his own: murder is made praiseworthy. Buddhism, on the other
hand, aims at <i>removing</i> the unwholesome
mental elements. For this, the special techniques of meditation (<i>bhaavanaa</i>)
are necessary.</p>

<p>Good
kamma is the product of wholesome states of
mind. And to be certain of this, it is essential to gain an
understanding of the states of consciousness and one's most
secret
motives. Unless this is done, it is next to impossible to cultivate
exclusively wholesome actions, because in every human consciousness
there is a complex of hidden motivations. They are hidden because we do
not wish to acknowledge them. In every human being there is a built-in
defence mechanism that prevents him from seeing himself too clearly. If
he should happen to be confronted with his subconscious mind too
suddenly he may receive an unpleasant psychological shock. His
carefully constructed image of himself is rudely shattered. He is
appalled by the crudity, the unsuspected savagery, of his real
motivations.</p>

<p>The
keen and energetic social worker may find that
he is really actuated by a desire to push other people around, to tell
them what is best for them and to force them to do his will. The
professional humanitarian, always championing the underdog, may find to
his distress that his outbursts of high moral indignation at the
injustices of society are nothing more than an expression of his real
hatred of other humans, made respectable to himself and others by the
guise of concern for the victims of society. Or each may be
compensating for hidden defects in his own personality. All these facts
are well known to present-day psychologists; but how many people submit
themselves to the analyst's probings? Buddhism teaches us to
do it for
ourselves, and to make ourselves immune to unpleasant or shocking
revelations by acknowledging beforehand that there is no immutable
personality, no "self" to be either admired or deplored.</p>

<p>An action (kamma), once it is performed, is finished so far as its actual
performance is concerned. It is also irreversible.</p>

<p>The moving finger writes, and having writ<br>

Moves on; nor all your piety nor wit<br>

Can lure it back to cancel half a line&mdash;<br>

Nor all your tears wash out one word of it.</p>

<p>&mdash; Edward Fitzgerald: The <i>Rubaiyyat </i>of<i> Omar Khayyam</i></p>

<p>The
moving finger is no mystery to one who
understands kamma and vipaaka. Ask not whose finger writes upon the
wall. It is thine own.</p>

<p>What
remains of the action is its potential, the
inevitability of its result. It is a force released into the stream of
time, and in time it must have its fruition. And when, for good or ill,
it has fructified, like all else its force must pass away&mdash;and
then the
kamma and the vipaaka alike are no more. But as the old kammas die, new
ones are created&mdash;every moment of every waking hour. So the
life-process, involved in suffering, is carried on. It is borne along
on the current of craving. It is in its essence nothing but that
craving, that desire&mdash;the desire that takes many forms, is
insatiable,
is self-renewing. As many-formed as Proteus; as undying as the phoenix.</p>

<p>But
when there comes the will to end desire, a
change takes place. The mind that craved gratification in the fields of
sense now turns away. Another desire, other than that of the senses,
gathers power and momentum. It is the desire for cessation, for peace,
for the end of pain and sorrow. The desire for Nibbaana.</p>

<p>Now
this desire is incompatible with all other
desires. Therefore, if it becomes strong enough it kills all other
desires. Gradually they fade out; first the grosser cravings springing
from the three immoral roots; then the higher desires; then the
attachments, all wilt and fade out, extinguished by the one
overmastering desire for Nibbaana.</p>

<p>And
as they wilt and fade out, and no more
result-producing actions take their place, so the current of the
life-continuum dries up. Unwholesome actions cannot be performed,
because their roots have withered away; there is no more basis for
them. The wholesome deeds in their turn become sterile; since they are
not motivated by desire they do not project any force into the future.
In the end there is no craving force left to produce another birth.
Everything has been swallowed up by the desire for the extinction of
desire.</p>

<p>And
when the object of that desire is gained, can it
any longer be a desire? Does a man continue to long for what he has
already got? The last desire of all is not self-renewing; it is
self-destroying. For in its fulfilment is its own death. Nibbaana is
attained.</p>

<p>Therefore
the Buddha said, "For the final cessation of suffering, <i>all</i>
kamma, wholesome and unwholesome, must be transcended, must be
abandoned. Putting aside good and evil, one attains Nibbaana. There is
no other way."</p>

<p>The
Arahat lives then only experiencing the residuum
of his life-span. And when that last remaining impetus comes to an end
the aggregates of his personality come to an end too, never to be
reconstructed, never to be replaced. In their continual renewal there
was suffering; now there is release. In their coming together there was
illusion&mdash;the illusion of self. Now there is Reality.</p>

<p>And
Reality is beyond conception.</p>

<a name="KammaCausality"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Kamma and Causality</a></p>

<p class="author">Francis Story</p>

<p>"Does
everything happen in our lives according to
kamma?" This question is not one that can be answered by a plain
affirmation or denial, since it involves the whole question of
free-will against determinism, or, in familiar language, "fatalism."
The nearest that can be given to a simple answer is to say that most of
the major circumstances and events of life are conditioned by kamma,
but not all.</p>

<p>If
everything, down to the minutest detail, were
pre-conditioned either by kamma or by the physical laws of the
universe, there would be no room in the pattern of strict causality for
the functioning of free-will. It would therefore be impossible for us
to free ourselves from the mechanism of cause and effect; it would be
impossible to attain Nibbaana.</p>

<p>In
the sphere of everyday events and the incidents
of life such as sickness, accidents and such common experiences, every
effect requires more than one cause to bring it about, and kamma is in
most cases the predisposing factor which enables the external
influences to combine and produce a given result. In the case of
situations that involve a moral choice, the situation itself is the
product of past kamma, but the individual's reaction to it is
a free
play of will and intention. For example, a man, as the result of
previous unwholesome (<i>akusala</i>) kamma either in the
present life
or some past birth, may find himself in a situation of desperate
poverty in which he is sorely tempted to steal, commit a robbery, or in
some other way carry into the future the unwholesome actions of the
past. This is a situation with a moral content, because it involves the
subject in a nexus of ethical potentials. Here his own freedom of
choice comes into play; he has the alternative of choosing further
hardship rather than succumb to the temptation of crime.</p>

<p>In
the <i>pa.ticca-samuppaada, </i>the cycle of
dependent origination, the factors belonging to previous births, that
is, ignorance and the actions conditioned by it, are summarised as the
kamma-process of the past. This kamma produces consciousness,
name-and-form, sense-perception fields, contact and sensation as its
resultants, and this is known as the present effect. Thus the physical
and mental make-up (<i>naama-ruupa</i>) is the
manifestation of past
kamma operating in the present, as also are the phenomena cognised and
experienced through the channels of sense. But running along with this
is another current of action, that which is controlled by the will, and
this is known as the present volitional activity; it is the counterpart
in the present of the kamma-process of the past. It governs the factors
of craving, grasping and becoming.</p>

<p>This
means, in effect, that the current of
"becoming" which has its source in past kamma, at the point where it
manifests as individual reaction&mdash;as for example in the degree
of
craving engendered as the result of pleasurable
sensation&mdash;comes under
the control of the will, so that while the subject has no further
control over the situations in which he finds himself, having himself
created them in the past, he yet has a subjective control over his
response to them, and it is out of this that he creates the conditions
of his future. The present volitional activity then takes effect in the
form of future resultants, and these future resultants are the
counterpart in the future of the kammic resultants of the present. In
an exactly similar way it dominates the future birth-state and
conditions, which in the <i>pa.ticca-samuppaada </i>are
expressed as
arising, old age and death, etc. The entire cycle implies a dynamic
progression in which the state conditioned by past actions is at the
same time the womb of present actions and their future results.</p>

<p>Kamma
is not only an integral law of the process of
becoming; it is itself that process, and the phenomenal personality is
but the present manifestation of its activity. The Christian axiom of
"hating the sin but loving the sinner" is meaningless from the Buddhist
standpoint. There is action, but no performer of the action; the "sin"
and the "sinner" cannot be dissociated; we are our actions, and nothing
apart from them.</p>

<p class="subhd">Modes of Conditioning</p>

<p>The
conditioned nature of all mental and physical phenomena is analysed
under twenty-four heads, called in Pali <i>paccaya</i>
(modes of conditioning). Each of the twenty-four <i>paccayas </i>is
a contributing factor to the arising of conditioned things. The
thirteenth mode is <i>kamma-paccaya, </i>and
stands for the past actions which form the base, or condition, of
something arising later. The six sense organs and fields of
sense-cognition&mdash;that is, the physical organs of sight,
hearing, smell,
taste, touch and mental awareness&mdash;which, as we have seen,
arise at
birth in association with name-and-form, provide the condition-base for
the arising of subsequent consciousness, and hence for the mental
reactions following upon it. But here it should be noted that although
kamma as volition is associated with the mental phenomena that have
arisen, the phenomena themselves are not kamma-results. The fourteenth
mode is kamma-result condition, or <i>vipaaka</i>, and
stands as a
condition by way of kamma-result to the mental and physical phenomena
by establishing the requisite base in the five fields of
sense-consciousness.</p>

<p>That
there are events that come about through causes
other than kamma is demonstrable by natural laws. If it were not so, to
try to avoid or cure sickness would be useless. If there is a
predisposition to a certain disease through past kamma, and the
physical conditions to produce the disease are also present, the
disease will arise. But it may also come about that all the physical
conditions are present, but, through the absence of the
kamma-condition, the disease does not arise; or that, with the presence
of the physical causes the disease arises even in the absence of a
kamma condition. A philosophical distinction is therefore to be made
between those diseases which are the result of kamma and those which
are produced solely by physical conditions; but since it is impossible
to distinguish between them without a knowledge of past births, all
diseases must be treated as though they are produced by merely physical
causes. When the Buddha was attacked by Devadatta and was wounded in
the foot by a stone, he was able to explain that the injury was the
result of some violence committed in a previous life plus the action of
Devadatta which enabled the kamma to take effect. Similarly, the
violent death of Moggallaana Thera was the combined result of his kamma
and the murderous intention of the rival ascetics whose action provided
the necessary external cause to bring it about.</p>

<p class="subhd">Causality</p>

<p>The
process of causality, of which kamma and
vipaaka are only one action-result aspect, is a cosmic, universal
interplay of forces. Concerning the question of free-will in a
causally-conditioned universe, the view of reality presented by Henri
Bergson, which when it was postulated was new to the West, throws
considerable light on the Buddhist concept. Life, says Bergson, is an
unceasing becoming, which preserves the past and creates the future.
The solid things which seem to be stable and to endure, which seem to
resist this flowing, which seem more real than the flowing, are
periods, cuts across the flowing, views that our mind takes of the
living reality of which it is a part, in which it lives and moves,
views of the reality prescribed and limited by the needs of its
particular activity.</p>

<p>Here
we have a Western interpretation of <i>avijjaa</i>
(ignorance) &mdash;" views of the reality prescribed and limited by
the needs of its particular activity"&mdash;and of <i>anicca,
</i>the unceasing becoming, the principle of change and
impermanence. Bergson also includes in his system <i>anattaa</i>
(no-self), for in this process of unceasing change there is the change
only&mdash;no "thing" that changes. So, says Bergson, when we
regard our
action as a chain of complementary parts linked together, each action
so viewed is rigidly conditioned, yet when we regard our whole
life-current as one and indivisible, it may be free. So also with the
life-current which we may take to be the reality of the universe; when
we view it in its detail as the intellect presents it to us, it appears
as an order of real conditioning, each separate state having its ground
in an antecedent state, yet as a whole, as the living impulse (kamma),
it is free and creative. We are free, says Bergson, when our acts
spring from our whole personality, when they express that personality.
These acts are not unconditioned, but the conditions are not external;
they are in our character, which is ourself. In other and Buddhist
words, our <i>sa"nkhaara, </i>or kamma-formation of the
past, is the personality, and that is conditioned by nothing but our
own volition, or <i>cetanaa.</i></p>

<p>Bergson
details an elaborate philosophy of space and
time to give actuality to this dynamic view, which he calls "Creative
Evolution," and his general conclusion is that the question of
free-will against determinism is wrongly postulated; the problem, like
the indeterminate questions of Buddhism, cannot be answered because it
is itself a product of that peculiar infirmity, that "special view of
reality prescribed and limited by the needs of a particular activity,"
which in Buddhism is called <i>avijjaa</i>, the primal
nescience.</p>

<p>The
concept of causality in the world of physics has
undergone modifications of a significant order in the light of quantum
physics and the increase of our knowledge regarding the atomic
structure of matter. Briefly the present position may be stated thus:
while it is possible to predict quantitatively the future states of
great numbers of atomic units, it is not possible to pre-determine the
state or position of any one particular atom. There is a margin of
latitude for the behaviour of the individual unit which is not given to
the mass as a whole. In human terms, it may be possible to predict from
the course of events that a certain nation, Gondalia, will be at war by
a certain date; but it is not possible to predict of any individual
Gondalian that he will be actively participating in the war. He may be
a conscientious objector, outside the war by his own decision; or he
may be physically disqualified, outside the war because of conditions
over which he has no control. We may say, "Gondalia will be at war,"
but not "That Gondalian will be in the war." On the other hand, if we
know that one particular Gondalian is not physically fit we may say
confidently that he will not be in the war; the element we cannot
predict with any degree of certainty is the free-will of the Gondalian
individual, which may make of him a chauvinist and national Gondalian
hero, or a pacifist and inmate of a concentration camp.</p>

<p class="subhd">How Kamma Operates</p>

<p>Coming
to the details of the ways in which kamma operates, it must be
understood that by kamma is meant volitional action only. <i>Cetanaaha.m
bhikkhave kamma.m</i> <i>vadaami</i>&mdash;"
Volition, intention, O bhikkhus, is what I call kamma," is the
definition given by the Buddha. Greed, hatred and delusion are the
roots of unwholesome kamma; unselfishness, amity and wisdom are the
roots of wholesome kamma. As the seed that is sown, so must be the tree
and the fruit of the tree; from an impure mind and intention, only
impure thoughts, words and deeds can issue; from such impure thoughts,
words and deeds only evil consequences can result.</p>

<p>The
results themselves may come about in the same lifetime; when this
happens it is called <i>di.t.thadhamma-vedaniiya-kamma, </i>and
the line of causality between action and result is often clearly
traceable, as in the case of crime which is followed by punishment.
Actions which bear their results in the next birth are called <i>upapajja-vedaniiya-kamma,
</i>and
it frequently happens that people who remember their previous life
remember also the kamma which has produced their present conditions.</p>

<p>Those
actions which ripen in successive births are known as <i>aparaapariya-vedaniiya-kamma;
</i>these
are the actions which have, by continual practice, become habitual, and
tend to take effect over and over again in successive lives. The
repetition condition (<i>aasevana-paccaya</i>) is
the twelfth of the twenty-four <i>paccayas, </i>and
relates to that kamma-consciousness in which the preceding
impulse-moments (<i>javana-citta</i>) are
a condition by way of repetition to all the succeeding ones. This is
known to modern psychology as a habit-formation, and is a very strong
conditioning factor of mind and character. Buddhism urges the continual
repetition of good actions, deeds of <i>mettaa </i>and
charity, and
the continual dwelling of the mind on good and elevating subjects, such
as the qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, in order to
establish a strong habit-formation along good and beneficial lines.</p>

<p>The
three kinds of kamma described above, however,
may be without any resultants if the other conditions necessary for the
arising of the kamma-result are lacking. Rebirth among inferior orders
of beings, for instance, will prevent or delay the beneficial results
of a habitual kamma. There is also <i>counteractive kamma</i>
which, if it is stronger than they, will inhibit their fruition. Kamma
which is thus prevented from taking effect is called<i>
ahosi-kamma. </i>Just
as there are events which occur without kamma as a cause, so there are
actions which, as potentials, remain unrealised. These actions,
however, are usually the weak and relatively unimportant ones, actions
not prompted by any strong impulse and carrying with them little moral
significance.</p>

<p>Functionally,
the various kinds of kamma operate according to four classifications.
The first is <i>generative kamma</i> (<i>janaka-kamma</i>)
which produces the five aggregate complex of name-and-form at birth and
through all the stages of its arising during the life-continuum. The
second category is that of <i>sustaining</i> <i>kamma
</i>(<i>upatthambhaka-kamma</i>)<i>, </i>which
is void of kamma-results and is only capable of sustaining
kamma-resultants that have already come into being. In the third
category comes <i>counteractive kamma </i>(<i>upapii.laka-kamma</i>),
which by reason of its moral or immoral force suppresses other
kamma-results and delays or prevents their arising. Last in this
classification according to functions comes <i>destructive kamma
</i>(<i>upacchedaka-kamma</i>)<i>; </i>this
is kamma of such potency that it utterly destroys the influence of
weaker kamma and substitutes its own kamma-results. It may be strong
enough to cut short the life-span so that it is destructive kamma in
the literal sense.</p>

<p>The
light and insignificant actions which we perform
in the course of our daily lives have their results, but they are not
dominant factors unless they become part of a habit-formation.
Important actions which become habitual, either wholesome or
unwholesome, are known as <i>bahula-kamma, </i>and their
effects take
precedence over those of actions which are morally insignificant or
rarely performed. Those actions which are rooted in a very strong moral
or immoral impulse, and take a drastic form, are known as <i>garuka-kamma;
</i>they also tend to fall into the <i>di.t.thadhamma-vedaniiya-kamma</i>
class and take effect in the same lifetime, or else in the next
existence. Such actions are: drawing the blood of a Buddha, the murder
of an Arahat, the killing of parents, and attempts to disrupt the
Sangha.1 Although these are
the chief
demeritorious actions, there are many others of lesser weight which
bear results in the next birth in the absence of <i>garuka-kamma.
</i>The same applies to good <i>garuka-kamma.</i></p>

<p><i>Di.t.thadhamma-vedaniiya-kamma
</i>provides us
with data for studying the operation of the law of cause and effect
objectively. In the usual course of things crime brings its own
consequences in the same lifetime, by a clearly traceable sequence of
events, but this does not invariably happen. For a crime to receive its
due punishment a complicated machinery of causes has to be brought into
operation. First there has to be the act of crime, the kamma. Its
punishment then depends upon the existence of criminal laws, of a
police force, of the circumstances which enable the criminal to be
detected, and many subsidiary factors. It is only when all these
combine that the crime receives its due punishment in the same
lifetime. If the external factors are missing, the kamma alone will not
bring about its consequences immediately, and we say the criminal has
gone unpunished.</p>

<p>This,
however, is not the case; sooner or later
either in the same lifetime or a subsequent one, circumstances will
link together, albeit indirectly, and give an opportunity for the kamma
to produce its results. Hence from the Buddhist standpoint the question
of capital punishment rests not on considerations of mercy to the
murderer, which must always be a source of contention since mercy to a
criminal implies a social injustice to the victim and lack of
protection to potential victims; it rests on a consideration of the
kamma-resultants to those who are instrumental in punishing him with
death, since it is kamma of the worst order to kill or cause another to
take life.</p>

<p>It
is not possible here to enter into a discussion
of the moral difference between the action of one who kills another
from greed or anger and one who carries out a sentence of death in the
course of his duties to society. That there is a difference cannot be
doubted, yet for Buddhist psychology it is clear that no act of killing
can be accomplished without the arising of a hate-impulse in the mind.
To take life quite disinterestedly, as advocated in the <i>Bhagavad
Gita, </i>is
a psy-chological impossibility; there must, in any case, be desire for
the accomplishment of the act, or the act itself could never be carried
out. This applies to every action except those performed by the Arahat.
Since there is no "unchanging Atman" no distinction can be made between
the deed and the doer.</p>

<p class="subhd">Rebirth</p>

<p>The
mode, circumstances and nature of the next birth are conditioned by
what is known as the <i>death-proximate kamma </i>(<i>mara.naasanna-kamma</i>)<i>,
</i>which is the volition, wholesome or unwholesome, that
is present immediately before death. With this is associated the <i>pa.tisandhi-vi~n~naa.na
</i>or
connecting consciousness between one manifestation and another. At the
moment just preceding death, the death-proximate kamma may take the
form of a reflex of some good or bad deed performed during the dying
person's life. This sometimes presents itself to the
consciousness as a
symbol, like the dream symbols of Freudian psychology. It may bring
with it an indication of the future existence, a glimpse of the realm (<i>loka</i>)
in which rebirth is about to take place. It is due to the arising of
some unwholesome consciousness from past kamma that the dying sometimes
exhibit fear, while others, experiencing wholesome death-proximate
kamma, die with a smile on their lips, seeing themselves welcomed by
celestial beings or their friends who have passed away before them.
Everyone who has been present at death beds can recall examples of both
kinds.</p>

<p>When
none of these kamma-manifestations is present,
however, as with those who die in a state of complete unconsciousness,
the next birth is determined by what is called <i>reserved kamma
</i>(<i>ka.tattaa-kamma</i>)<i>. </i>This
is the automatic result of whatever kamma of the past is strongest, be
it good or bad, and has not yet borne fruit or exhausted its force.
This may be weighty or habitual kamma.</p>

<p class="subhd">Heedfulness in Dying and When
Living</p>

<p>The
importance of keeping the consciousness
active and faculties alert up to the moment of death is stressed in
Buddhist psychology. Part of the benefit of <i>mara.naanussati, </i>the
meditation on death, is that it enables
one to approach the thought of death undismayed, in full possession of
one's faculties and with control of the mental impulses.
Instead of
charging us to remember our sins and approach death in fear, Buddhism
instructs us to call to mind our good actions, put aside terror and
meet death with the calm confidence of one whose destiny is under his
own control. It is a positive attitude in place of the negative and
depressing mental state encouraged by other religions. Modern
psychology advises the cultivation of such an optimistic attitude
throughout life. Buddhism goes further, and shows it to be a necessary
safeguard when we stand on the threshold of a new existence.</p>

<p>It
has already been said that those who are able to
remember previous lives can trace the course of kamma and vipaaka from
one birth to another. They are the only people who are in a position to
differentiate clearly between the events that occur because of kamma
and those that are caused by external agencies. It is certain, however,
that predominantly good kamma will save us from most of the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune, or help us to rise above whatever
obstacles are set in our path. <i>The</i> <i>need
for human</i> <i>endeavour is always present, </i>for
in the very enjoyment of the fruits of good kamma we are generating a
new series of actions to bear their own results in the future.</p>

<p>It
cannot be too often or too emphatically repeated
that the true understanding of the law of kamma is the absolute
opposite of fatalism. The man who is born to riches on account of his
past deeds of charity cannot afford to rest on his laurels. He is like
a man with a substantial bank balance; he may either live on his
capital until he exhausts it, which is foolish, or he can use it as an
investment and increase it. The only investment we can take with us out
of this life into the next is good kamma; it therefore behooves every
man who is, in the common phrase, "blessed" with riches, to use those
riches wisely in doing good.</p>

<p>If
everyone understood the law of kamma there would
be an end to the greed of the rich and the envy of the poor. Every man
would strive to give away as much as he could in charity&mdash;or
at least
spend his money on projects beneficial to mankind. On the other hand
there would be no burning feeling of injustice on the part of the
"have-nots," since they would recognise that their condition is due to
their own past kamma, while at the same time its crushing effects would
be alleviated by the generosity and social conscience of the rich. The
result would be a co-operative scheme of sharing, in which both would
prosper.</p>

<p>This
is
the practical plan of living that Buddhism suggests to us; it is sane,
ethical and inspiring, and it is the one answer that a free world can
make to the anti-religious materialistic ideologies. To put it into
practice would be the greatest step forward in mankind's
social
as well as spiritual progress, and one that must be made if we are to
save our civilisation from the terrible consequences of greed, hatred
and delusion. It is not enough to have a knowledge of the law of kamma:
it must be used as applied science in the ordering of personal and
national life for the realization of a happier, more stable and more
regulated phase of human history.</p>

<a name="ActionReaction"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Action and Reaction in
Buddhist Teachings</a></p>

 <p class="author">Leonard
A. Bullen</p>

<p>The
whole
universe is governed by law, and the unbroken sequence of action and
reaction occurs in mental and moral operations just as strictly as in
physical processes. In consequence, the Buddha-doctrine emphasizes that
morally skilful thought, speech and action bring happiness to the doer
at some time or other, while in the same way activities which are
morally unskilful give rise to future suffering. That which determines
the moral skill of an activity&mdash;whether it be in thought,
speech
or bodily action&mdash;is the volition or mental purpose which
motivates it. Where it is based on generosity, on goodwill, or on
selfless motives, it is morally skilful, whereas when the purpose which
motivates it springs from greed, hatred or delusion it is regarded as
morally unskilful.</p>

<p>Thus the Buddha-doctrine stresses the need for developing a clear
comprehension of the purpose behind every activity at every level, at
the levels of thought, of speech and of bodily action. Some of these
activities build up forces within the mind which eventually lead to an
increase in well-being, while others, being aimless or unskilful,
result in sorrow or frustration. Thus, if you take on almost any form
of mental culture, one of your most important aims should be to
comprehend more clearly the ultimate purpose behind all these
activities.</p>

<p>In this scientific and technological age, you are familiar with the
idea that physical effects have causes, that these effects also become
causes in their turn, and that in the ordinary course of events there
is no room for chance or luck. But while you accept this invariable
sequence of action and reaction in the material realm, you
don't
always recognize it in the moral sphere. The Buddha-doctrine affirms,
however, that the law of cause and effect applies just as invariably
and just as exactly in the moral sphere as it does in the physical
realm. This doctrine emphasizes the fact that everything in the
universe acts according to various laws, and that no being in the
universe can set aside or invalidate these laws. It defines five
systems of laws (pa~nca-niyaama).</p>

<p>The first of these is the law-system which concerns the rise and
fall&mdash;that is, the growth and decay&mdash;of physical
phenomena
under the action of heat. Second, there is the group of laws relating
to the generation or growth of vegetation and of the bodies of living
beings. The third law-system relates to mental action and reaction,
that is, to the action of the will and its results in terms of
happiness and suffering. Fourth, there are the various laws governing
the processes of the mind, the laws which are studied and applied by
psychologists. Finally, the fifth law-system groups together the
multiplicity of laws which relate to physical and mental phenomena in
general which are not embraced by the other systems of laws.</p>

<p>Of these five groups, you'll find that it is the third
law-system
that interests us in the present context. This, the law-system
governing the action of the will and its consequences, is only one of
the five groups of laws, but it is the one that is most directly
connected with your own happiness and sorrow, your own pains and
pleasures.</p>

<p>The original Buddhist terms that are sometimes translated as moral and
immoral, or as good and bad, may also be rendered as wholesome and
unwholesome. However, the terms skilful and unskilful are often used to
convey the meanings of the original terms, for a moral or wholesome
action is considered to be skilful because it eventually brings
enjoyment as a result; an immoral or unwholesome action, since in time
it brings suffering to the doer, is regarded as unskilful.</p>

<p>Any activity&mdash;morally good or otherwise&mdash;produces, of
course,
its normal physical result. If you throw a stone through a window it
will break the window, whether the motivation behind it be morally
skilful or otherwise. The broken window is the normal physical result
of the stone-throwing action.</p>

<p>But assuming that the action is motivated by some morally unskilful
volition (such as hatred) there will be a mental effect as well. The
exercise of hatred will strengthen the hatred which already exists
within the mind just as the exercise of a muscle will strengthen its
own tissues. In consequence, hatred will become a more dominant factor
in your mental make-up.</p>

<p>Now hatred is one of a group of mental factors which lead to suffering.
In some way or other, at some time in the near or distant future, this
mental factor will bring you suffering of some kind. The basic cause of
the suffering is not the action of throwing the stone, but the hatred
or ill-will present in the volitional act of throwing the stone.</p>

<p>Now it is conceivable that the action of throwing the stone through the
window might be motivated, not by hatred, but by some form of goodwill.
You might, for example, use this action as a means of letting air into
a smoke-filled room in a burning house in order to rescue someone in
the room. In such circumstances, the unselfishness you exercise in your
wholesome volitional action would strengthen your existing mental
factor of goodwill, and this strengthened mental factor would
eventually bring you into circumstances that would yield happiness.</p>

<p>Thus a morally skilful will-action brings enjoyment at some future
time, while an unwholesome volition eventuates in suffering. On the
other hand, an action which is not volitional (while of course it gives
rise to normal physical effects) does not produce any effects in terms
of strengthened mind-factors, and no effects in terms of future
happiness and suffering. Where there is no volition there is no moral
or immoral element.</p>

<p>The personal will or volition in its primal form is the urge to live,
the urge to survive as a self and to assert this selfhood. From this
fundamental will to live arise various tendencies, which we know as
urges, instincts, and desires, and which are accompanied by emotions.</p>

<p>In Buddhist psychology, the instincts and desires are all regarded as
manifestations of the fundamental will to live. This will to live, as a
rule, is simply called craving: it is the craving or thirst for
personal existence, the craving to live and survive as a self for
eternity. But the final freedom from unhappiness can be found only by
transcending personal existence.</p>

<p>The thirst for personal existence, rooted as it is in ignorance, is
said to be a primary condition on which all suffering depends. Thus the
ultimate aim of the practising Buddhist is to overcome craving by the
attainment of enlightenment.</p>

<p>This means, of course, to overcome desire, but only insofar as desire
is personal or self-centred. It has been said:</p>

<p><i>To
start from where we are now and unequivocally let go of every desire
would be to die, and to die is not to solve the problem of living.</i></p>

<p>&mdash; Houston Smith</p>

<p>The type of desire to be overcome, then, is what may be called ignorant
desire or irrational desire. To quote again:</p>

<p><i>The
desires for the basic necessities of life can be satisfied, whereas the
selfish desires of the ego can never be allayed. These do not spring
from the chemistry of the body but are purely mental
constructions&mdash;to be more and more, to have more and more:
money,
possessions, power, prestige, love; to outstrip and outshine all
others; to be supreme. It is an impossible dream which, if realized,
would not bring in its train either peace or happiness.</i></p>

<p><i>The greedy, the jealous, the envious can never be satisfied because
their dissatisfaction and unhappiness do not spring from any real
deprivation of the essentials of life, but from the defects and
distortions within their character.</i></p>

<p>&mdash; Mettaa</p>

<p>From all this you'll see that in Buddhism the first and last
enemy is considered to be ignorance&mdash;ignorance, not in the
sense
of lack of education, but in the sense of lack of the capacity for true
discernment.</p>

<p>You'll appreciate, too, that the final victory to be won is
the
victory of discernment or enlightenment, and that the principal weapon
in the battle is the weapon of right mindfulness in its various forms.</p>

<p>The personal will, then, is an aspect of the will to live, the blind
thirst for personal existence which, in human life, expresses itself by
way of various instinctive and emotional factors. These collectively
constitute the dynamic elements in mental life.</p>

<p>Buddhist psychology adopts a system of classifying the dynamic
mind-factors which is somewhat different from the classifications
you'll meet in Western psychology. It includes not only
instinctive elements but also mental habits developed from the
instincts, as well as thought-patterns deliberately cultivated in
opposition to the instincts.</p>

<p>This classification generally appears in Buddhist literature as a list
of fifty active mental factors (in contrast to the receptive mental
factors known as feeling and perception), and together these fifty
constitute the dynamic components of the mind. Some of them are
directly derived from the fundamental urge towards personal survival,
while others are cultivated in opposition to the egotistic tendencies,
but all of them help to determine behaviour. For this reason they can
be conveniently referred to as the fifty determinants.</p>

<p>There is no need to deal here with the determinants in detail. All that
we need to mention in the present context are three which are called
the roots of unskilful will-activity and their opposites, the three
roots of skilful volition.</p>

<p>The three roots of unskilful volition are greed, hatred and delusion,
while the opposite three&mdash;generosity, goodwill, and
discernment&mdash;are the roots of skilful will-activity.</p>

<p>Such activity may take the form of bodily action, it may take the form
of speech, or it may take the form of thought; but it is the motive
behind the activity, the mental determinant that gives rise to it, that
is all-important.</p>

<p>Thus if you think, speak or act from motives of greed, whether in an
obvious and intense form or in a subtle and disguised way, you thereby
strengthen greed in your mental make-up. On the other hand, when you
act from generosity you thereby strengthen this determinant in your own
mind.</p>

<p>It is the same with hatred and its opposite factor of goodwill. One who
allows himself to become angry or irritable immediately builds up in
his own mind the factor of hatred, whereas when he makes an effort to
be tolerant and patient with irritating people or annoying things he
increases the mental factor of goodwill within his mind.</p>

<p>Again, if you think, speak or act in a self-centred way, you are
allowing yourself to be motivated by delusion, for delusion in the
present context means primarily the delusion of self, together with the
self-deceit and feelings of superiority and inferiority that go along
with it. As a result you become more and more governed by this
delusion, for it becomes a stronger determinant than before.</p>

<p>When, on the other hand, you endeavour to discern the true nature of
the illusory self and to break free from self-deceit, you strengthen
the opposite factor of discernment. Thus discernment&mdash;or
non-delusion, as it is often called&mdash;becomes a stronger
determinant of your subsequent thought-processes.</p>

<p>Now the morally unskilful determinants that exist as parts of your
mental make-up, as you can see, retard your progress towards the final
liberation; thus we can speak of them as the "retardants."</p>
<br>

<p>In the same way, you can see that the morally skilful mind-factors help
you in your progress towards the final liberation; and therefore we can
also call them the "progressants."</p>

<p>You'll see from this that from the exercise of a particular
determinant there is an immediate effect within the mind. This
immediate effect is a strengthening of that determinant, which of
course makes it easier to arouse it in the future.</p>

<p>However, there is more to it than that. Each of the determinants that
we have been discussing, each of the active or dynamic factors that
help to make up the mind as a whole, can be visualized as an
accumulation of energy within the mind. You can regard each particular
determinant&mdash;generosity, for example, on the one hand, or
greed on
the other&mdash;as an accumulation of a specific sort of force
within
the mind, and each such force will eventually bring about its own kind
of experience at some time in the future.</p>

<p>This future experience is the result of the original
will-activity&mdash;the reaction to the original action. The
volitional
action in the first place causes an accumulation of a specific mental
force, and this force in its turn brings about its reaction in terms of
enjoyment or suffering. The accumulated force, therefore, can be termed
a "reaction-force."</p>

<p>An accumulation of the reaction-force of generosity will at some time
give rise to enjoyment of some kind, just as the accumulation of energy
within an electrical torch battery may at some time give rise to light.
The energy within the battery can give rise to light only when the
conditions are favourable: there must be an electric-light bulb, and
the switch of the torch must be turned on. The current can then flow
through the filament, which then glows with light. In the
process&mdash;unless the current is switched off or unless some
replenishment of the battery takes place&mdash;the energy will be
eventually completely discharged.</p>

<p>In much the same way, the accumulation of the reaction-force of
generosity can give rise to enjoyment only when the environment
provides suitable conditions; and, until the requisite environmental
conditions come about, the reaction-force remains in storage, so to
speak. When the suitable conditions do eventually appear, this
particular reaction-force will give rise to the enjoyment of happy
experiences, and in the process the accumulation will become less and
less until completely discharged, unless of course it is replenished by
further generosity.</p>

<p>In general, some sort of replenishment may be going on while the
discharge is taking place. If, while you're enjoying happy
experiences, you continue to exercise your generosity, then the
accumulation of this particular reaction-force will be replenished even
while it is being discharged. It is then like a water-tank from which
you're drawing off water but which is being replenished by
rain
at the same time.</p>

<p>However, if while enjoying the fruits of previous generous actions you
become selfish and greedy, then your mind is like a water-tank during a
drought: as the water is all drained off and never replenished, so your
accumulation of happiness-producing reaction-force is drained off until
finally discharged.</p>

<p>As with the mind-factor we know as generosity, so with its opposite
determinant, greed. When one gives way to self-desire in any form, the
accumulation of the reaction-force of greed is increased in
one's
mind. When at some future time the external conditions are suitable,
this accumulation will discharge by way of suffering. During suffering,
one may give way to further adverse states of mind, such as self-pity,
and this will add to the accumulated reaction-force. On the other hand,
one may develop patience and other favourable qualities of mind, and
thus this particular sorrow-producing accumulation will eventually be
fully discharged.</p>

<p>While each type of mind-factor is a particular reaction-force, in
general we can group them into two broad classes&mdash;first,
reaction-forces that lead to happiness, and second those that lead to
suffering. Often these are spoken of respectively as merit and demerit,
and thus we say that while one person who has a great stock of merit
will enjoy great happiness in the future, another who has stored up
much demerit will have to endure great suffering at some later time.</p>

<p>The reaction-forces that exist within the mind are stored, so to speak,
below the consciously accessible level of the mind. The subconscious
aspect of the mind, in Buddhist terminology, is called the
life-subcurrent. It is the current of mental energy which exists below
the threshold of consciousness, and it is thus the repository of the
resultants of all past actions and past experiences.</p>

<p>This life-subcurrent may for convenience be called the storehouse of
the residual reaction-forces from all previous will-actions; but you
must not take the idea of a storehouse too literally. The experiences
in our lives are not in any real sense stored anywhere in the same way
that water is stored in a tank, any more than apples are stored in an
apple tree.</p>

<p>You don't believe, of course, that apples are stored in an
apple
tree. Given the right external conditions of climate, soil, and
nutrition, the forces within the apple tree will cause apples to grow
on its branches; and in the same way, given the right external
conditions, the forces within the life-subcurrent will project or
precipitate experiences in accordance with the nature of these forces.</p>

<p>Wind is not stored somewhere in the air, but under the right conditions
of heat or cold, the air will expand or contract and give rise to wind.
In the same way, fire is not stored in the head of a match, but under
the right conditions of friction the match will give rise to fire.</p>

<p>Again, sound is not stored in a record; but given the necessary
conditions&mdash;when placed on a turn table of a
record-player&mdash;the formation of the record gives rise to sound.</p>

<p>Thus the experiences of life, together with their corresponding
happiness and suffering, are not stored in a literal sense in the
life-subcurrent, but under the right conditions these events will
develop as the apples develop on the branches of the apple tree.</p>

<p>Thus you can see that no reaction-force can take effect unless there
exist suitable conditions for its operation or discharge. As the
suitable conditions may not arise within your present lifetime, it
follows that you may not reap the enjoyment and suffering resulting
from these activities within your present lifetime.</p>

<p>You can see, then, that at the end of your present lifetime there will
exist many undischarged reaction-forces, and for many of your actions
the appropriate reactions will not have occurred as yet. In other
words, when you die there'll be an unexpended residue of
reaction-forces both progressant and retardant which have had no
opportunities to discharge during your present lifetime.</p>

<p>What happens to these unexpended or undischarged reaction-forces? When
you die, your body will disintegrate, of course; but the
Buddha-doctrine teaches that various components of the mind survive in
the form of a life-current, a current of mental energy, and that this
current of energy consists of undischarged reaction-forces. This is
what the life-current actually is, an ever-changing stream of
reaction-forces, and at your death this life-current will initiate a
new life and thus bring about the birth of a new being.</p>

<p>The new being is you yourself, being an unbroken continuation of the
life-current. The new being inherits all the
reaction-forces&mdash;all
the potentialities for happiness, for suffering, and for further
volitional activity&mdash;from the old being, who is also you
yourself.
From the point of view of continuity, the new being is the same as the
old being (although in another body), for the continuity of the
life-current is not broken in any way by the phase of death and rebirth.</p>

<p>You've seen that the moral law of action and reaction, as set
out
in the Buddha-doctrine, states that we each experience happiness and
suffering in exact proportion to the moral and immoral qualities of our
past activities. You've seen also that this same doctrine
teaches
that moral and immoral activities build up forces within the mind, and
these forces&mdash;reaction-forces, we have called
them&mdash;eventually precipitate experiences of happiness and
suffering.</p>

<p>This is perhaps an oversimplification of the matter, for in more exact
terms the Buddha-doctrine says that every cause has a number of
effects, while every effect arises from a number of causes. In other
words, nothing arises from only one cause, and nothing gives rise to
only one effect: everything is interwoven with many other things.
However, the main point is that morally skilful activity brings
enjoyment of some kind in its train while morally unskilful activity
brings suffering.</p>

<p>The concept of the reaction-force enables us to see how the Buddhist
idea of rebirth differs from non-Buddhist beliefs in reincarnation, for
what is reborn in Buddhist teachings is a life-current, not a soul in
the ordinary sense.</p>

<p>This brings us to the matter of the time at which a particular
reaction-force (generated by a specific will-activity) operates. If you
rob a bank and bungle your escape, you'll be caught
immediately
and soon punished. If you plan your escape well and make a success of
it, but nevertheless leave a few clues, you may not be caught for five
years, but when you are eventually punished you'll be able to
see
the connection between the cause (your immoral action) and the effect
in the shape of punishment. However, you may execute the robbery and
your escape so well that you will evade suspicion and punishment (a
convenient word in the present context but not a very exact one) may
not come until several lifetimes afterwards. Then you won't
be
able to see the connection between cause and effect.</p>

<p>Here again we are over-simplifying the position by talking as if one
cause brings about only one effect, but the question at issue is the
time at which a particular reaction-force operates.</p>

<p>

As we have already seen, a reaction-force cannot discharge its energy
until the conditions appropriate to its operation are suitable; and by
conditions we mean both the external or environmental conditions as
well as conditions within the mind itself. That means that if you carry
out a morally unskilful activity&mdash;such as a
robbery&mdash;during a
time when you are reaping the benefits of a past series of morally
skilful actions, you may not reap the adverse effects of the immoral
act until the opposite kind of reaction-force has run its course. You
say you're enjoying a run of good luck, and this is true
enough
so long as you realize that good luck is really the fruition of past
good activity.</p>

<p>

Similarly, if you carry out some act of generosity you can expect the
enjoyment of some sort of happiness as a result, but this may not be in
the near future or even in your present lifetime. You may perhaps be in
the midst of a long period of frustration and failure, the effect of
some past phase of morally unskilful activity whose reaction-force must
run its course and exhaust its energy.</p>

<p>

Thus the Buddha-doctrine teaches that some actions are immediately
effective, since their resulting reaction-forces are discharged soon
after their inception; but many will-actions are remotely effective,
for the reaction-forces they generate may not produce their reactions
in terms of happiness or suffering until many lifetimes afterwards.</p>

<p>

The effects of weak volitional actions may be neutralized by stronger
reaction-forces of an opposite nature. Thus, if a weak retardant
reaction-force is opposed by a stronger one of a progressant nature,
then the stronger may render the weaker ineffective, losing some of its
own energy in the process.</p>

<p>

This does not apply, however, to a strong reaction-force generated by a
very definite morally skilful or a very definite morally unskilful
activity. The reaction-forces built into the mental structure by such
activities can never be neutralized, and even though the suitable
conditions for their discharge don't arise until many
lifetimes
afterwards, they invariably become effective at some time. They are
therefore called indefinitely effective reaction-forces, and while
dormant they are classed as reserve reaction-forces.</p>

<p>

In contrast to indefinitely effective reaction-force, there is a kind
called weighty reaction-force, which is generated either by very
serious retardant will-activity or else by very exalted states of mind.
The operation of weighty reaction-force, the Buddha-doctrine states,
takes precedence over all other kinds.</p>

<p>

You can see that, however long may be the time-lag between the cause
and its effect, the end-result of volitional activity is inevitable.</p>

<p>

At first sight you might take this to imply that the present and the
future are completely and inflexibly governed by the past, and that you
can experience only what your past actions have determined for you.</p>

<p>

This fatalistic view, however, is really not a part of the Buddhist
doctrine of cause and effect. It is true that you are
largely&mdash;very largely&mdash;influenced by reaction-forces
generated by your past volitional activities, but they are not the only
forces in the mind: there is also the possibility of present volition.
Volition or will exists as a force within the mind, just as attention
and one-pointedness exist as forces within the mind. We're
not
entering into any discussion on free will, beyond mentioning that
everything we do is conditioned by internal and external factors; but
we must recognize that volition does exist in the sense that it
consists of the force of desire directed towards an objective.</p>

<p>

Since volition does exist as desire-force directed towards an
objective, we can see that we can use this volition to handle the
present results of past activity. By "handling" the present results of
past activity I don't mean that we can cancel these results;
I
mean that we can utilize our present experiences to help us to make
progress, or we can let these same experiences&mdash;pleasant as
well
as unpleasant&mdash;retard our progress. But to handle our present
experiences&mdash;to utilize them as a means of making
progress&mdash;we must develop the necessary moral skill.</p>

<p>

Although the present is conditioned by the past as the future is
conditioned by the present, the future is not unalterably fixed by the
past, for the future is dependent also on what we do with our present
powers of volition. In many circumstances, it is true that there may be
little or no scope for a constructive or progressant course of action,
for the pressure of reaction-forces from the past may be too great and
the present volition too weak. However, in general, even if you have no
choice of external action, at least it's possible to regulate
your mental and moral responses to a situation, even to a slight
extent. Thus, under a difficult set of conditions that you are unable
to alter, you can at least exercise patience and tolerance, facing the
situation without allowing it completely to overwhelm you.</p>

<p>

In this way, while going through a difficult period of painful
reaction-force results, you're at least building up within
your
mental structure new progressant reaction-forces, thus using the
situation to its best advantage.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Questions and Answers about Kamma and Its Fruit</a></p>

 <p class="author">Nina
van Gorkom</p>

<p class="hd">I</p>

<p>

A. When people have an unpleasant experience they are inclined to ask:
"Why did this have to happen to me?" One might be very good and kind to
other people and yet receive unkind words in return. Could you tell me
whether it is true that good deeds will bring a good result? I
sometimes doubt it.</p>

<p>

B. People ask this question because they do not always understand the
reason why they have to suffer in life. It is difficult to know which
cause in the past brings about this or that unpleasant experience at
the present moment. The Buddha said that everything that happens must
have a cause. When we suffer it must have a cause either in the far
past or in the proximate past. If we know how causes and effects in our
lives are interrelated, it will help us to develop the right attitude
towards unpleasant experiences and sorrow.</p>

<p>

A. Are the bad deeds one did in the past the cause of unpleasant
experiences at the present moment? The deeds which are already done
belong to the past. How can those deeds bring a result later on?</p>

<p>

B. In order to have a deeper understanding of how cause and effect are
interrelated it is necessary to know first what motivates good and bad
deeds; moreover we should know how we accumulate wholesome tendencies
in doing wholesome deeds and how we accumulate unwholesome tendencies
in doing unwholesome deeds.</p>

<p>

A. Why do you use the words "wholesome" and "unwholesome" instead of
good and bad?</p>

<p>

B. The words "good" and "bad" generally imply a moral judgement. The
Buddha would not judge people as "good" or "bad." He explained about
the conditions for their behaviour and about the effects of
wholesomeness and unwholesomeness. An unwholesome deed is a deed which
brings harm to oneself or to other people, either at the moment the
unwholesome deed is done or later on, whereas a wholesome deed is one
which will lead to happiness. Unwholesome is in Pali akusala, and
wholesome is kusala. With unwholesome mental states or "akusala cittas"
one can perform unwholesome deeds or "akusala kamma"; and with
wholesome mental states or "kusala cittas" one can perform wholesome
deeds or "kusala kamma."</p>

<p>

A. What is a citta? Is it a soul or "self" which directs the deeds? Is
it under one's control whether one will have a kusala citta
which
can perform kusala kamma, or is it beyond control?</p>

<p>

B. A citta is not a soul or "self." There are many different cittas
which succeed one another, there is no citta which lasts. Each citta
which arises falls away immediately. We can experience at one moment
that we have an akusala citta. However, this does not last, it falls
away again. At another moment we might experience that we have a kusala
citta; this does not last either, it falls away again. There can only
be one citta at a time; we cannot have an akusala citta at the same
moment as a kusala citta. Cittas replace one another continuously. How
can we take something for self if it does not even last for a second?</p>

<p>

It is not in our power to have wholesome cittas whenever we want to.
People would like to be good the whole day but they cannot have kusala
cittas continuously; it is beyond their control.</p>

<p>

All cittas are beyond control. We cannot help it that we like certain
people and certain things, and that we dislike other people and things.
We cannot direct all our thoughts, we may be absent-minded although we
do not want to. No two people can have the same thoughts, even if they
think of the same object, for example, of a country where they both
have been. One's thoughts depend on many conditions, for
example,
on experiences and accumulated tendencies in the past, on the object
which presents itself at the present moment, on good or bad friends, or
on the food one has eaten.</p>

<p>

As it is not in one's power to have a certain citta at a
certain
moment, we cannot say that there is a "self" which directs our deeds.
Our actions depend on the tendencies that have been accumulated in the
past and on many other conditions.</p>

<p>

A. I notice that some people always seem to do the wrong thing in life,
whereas for other people it is not difficult to be generous and honest.
What is the reason that people are so different?</p>

<p>

B. People are so different because of different tendencies and
inclinations which have been accumulated in the past. People who are
very often angry accumulate anger. When the accumulated anger is strong
enough they will perform akusala kamma through speech or deeds.
Everybody has accumulated both unwholesome and wholesome tendencies.</p>

<p>

A. Is it correct that good and bad deeds performed in the past are
never lost, that they continue to have an influence at the present
moment?</p>

<p>

B. That is true. Experiences one had in the past, and good and bad
deeds committed in the past, have been accumulated and they condition
cittas arising in the present time. If the citta at the present moment
is akusala citta, there is a new accumulation of unwholesomeness, and
if the citta at the present moment is kusala citta, there is a new
accumulation of wholesomeness.</p>

<p>

Therefore cittas which arise are not only conditioned by the object
that presents itself through eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body-sense or
mind, but they are conditioned as well by the tendencies and
inclinations accumulated in the past and by many other factors.</p>

<p>

Cittas are beyond control; they are, as the Buddha said, "anattaa."
When the Buddha said that everything is anattaa, he meant that one
cannot have power over anything at all. Everything in our life occurs
because there are conditions, and everything falls away again.</p>

<p>

Good deeds and bad deeds which we performed will bring their result
accordingly. The result will take place when it is the right time, when
there are the right conditions for the result to take place. It is not
in anyone's power to have the result arise at this or at that
moment. Cause and result are beyond control, they are anattaa.</p>

<p>

A. I understand that akusala cittas which perform akusala kamma are
cause and that those cannot bring a pleasant result; they will bring an
unpleasant result, whereas kusala cittas which perform kusala kamma
will bring a good result. Each cause will bring its result accordingly.
Could you explain how the result is brought about? Is it a punishment
or a reward for one's deeds?</p>

<p>

B. There is no question of punishment or reward because there is no one
who punishes or rewards. It is the course of nature that one reaps what
one has sown. Accumulated akusala kamma produces at the right time a
citta which experiences an unpleasant object; this citta is the result
of a bad deed one did in the past. Accumulated kusala kamma produces at
the right time a citta which experiences a pleasant object; this citta
is the result of a good deed one did in the past. The citta which is
result is called "vipaakacitta" There will be different results at
different moments. For most people it is not possible to find out which
deed of the past produces the result one receives at the present
moment. However, it is of no use to know in detail what happened in the
past; we should only be concerned about the present moment. It is
enough to know that akusala kamma produces an unpleasant result and
that kusala kamma produces a pleasant result. The result is produced
either shortly afterwards or later on. We cannot blame other people for
an unpleasant result we receive. An unpleasant result is the
consequence of our own bad deeds.</p>

<p>

A. How often during the day is there vipaaka? Is there vipaaka at this
moment?</p>

<p>

B. Yes, there is vipaaka now, because you are seeing and hearing. Every
time you are seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and experiencing a
tangible object through the body-sense there is vipaaka. All
impressions that we experience through the five senses are vipaaka.</p>

<p>

A. How can I find out whether there is pleasant or unpleasant vipaaka?
I am seeing right now but I have no pleasant or unpleasant feeling
about it.</p>

<p>

B. It is not always possible to find out whether the object is pleasant
or unpleasant. When we see or hear we cannot always find out whether
there is kusala vipaaka or akusala vipaaka. When we feel pain or when
we are sick we can be sure that there is akusala vipaaka. The moment of
vipaakacitta is very short, it falls away immediately.</p>

<p>

When we see, we experience colour through the eyes. Then we like or
dislike it, we recognize it, we think about it. The seeing of colour is
vipaaka. Like or dislike and thinking about the object are not vipaaka.
Those functions are performed by other cittas, which are akusala cittas
or kusala cittas. The cittas that like or dislike, and the cittas that
think about the object, are not results but causes; they can motivate
deeds which will bring fresh results.</p>

<p>

All cittas succeed one another so rapidly that there seems to be only
one citta. We are inclined to think that like or dislike and thinking
are still vipaaka, but that is a delusion.</p>

<p>

A. Does everyone receive both akusala vipaaka and kusala vipaaka?</p>

<p>

B. Everyone has accumulated both unwholesome deeds and wholesome deeds,
therefore everyone will receive both akusala vipaaka and kusala
vipaaka. However, we can develop understanding of cause and effect and
this helps us to be patient, even under unpleasant conditions. For
instance, when we understand what vipaaka is we will be less inclined
to feel sorry for ourselves or to blame other people when there is
akusala vipaaka. If we feel sorry for ourselves or blame other people,
there is a new accumulation of unwholesomeness and this will bring us
more sorrow in the future.</p>

<p>

A. But I cannot help disliking unpleasant vipaaka. How can I change my
attitude?</p>

<p>

B. You can change your attitude by understanding what is vipaaka and
what is no longer vipaaka. It is very important to know that the moment
we feel dislike or regret is not the same as the moment of vipaaka.
People are inclined to think that the dislike which arises after the
vipaaka is still vipaaka. When they say "This is just vipaaka," they do
not distinguish unpleasant feelings from the moments of vipaaka. If
they do not really know what is vipaaka and what is not vipaaka but
akusala citta, or akusala kamma, they accumulate unwholesomeness all
through their lives. By ignorance, by not knowing when the citta is
akusala, one accumulates unwholesomeness.</p>

<p>

A. I am inclined to blame people who speak harsh words to me, even when
I am so kind to them. Are those people not the cause that I receive
unpleasant vipaaka?</p>

<p>

B. We are inclined to think in this way if we haven't yet
understood what vipaaka is.</p>

<p>

Let us analyse what is really happening when we hear harsh words spoken
by someone else. When those words are produced by akusala cittas, it is
an unpleasant object we receive through the ear. It is not really we
who receive the unpleasant object, but the vipaakacitta receives the
unpleasant object through the ear. The vipaakacitta is the result of
akusala kamma performed in the past. This was the right moment that the
akusala kamma, performed in the past, caused vipaakacittas to arise at
the present moment. The person who speaks harsh words to us is not the
cause of akusala vipaaka; the cause is within ourselves. Someone who
speaks harsh words to us is only one of the many conditions for
vipaakacittas to arise. Our own accumulated akusala kamma is the real
cause of akusala vipaaka.</p>

<p>

A. It seems to me that kamma is a fate which directs our lives.</p>

<p>

B. Kamma is not an unchangeable fate outside ourselves, but our own
accumulated unwholesome and wholesome deeds, and at the right moment it
will produce its results in the form of vipaakacittas.</p>

<p>

A. If a third person would pass and if he would hear harsh words spoken
to me, he might have akusala vipaaka as well, although the words are
not directed to him. Is that right?</p>

<p>

B. If it is the right moment for him to have akusala vipaaka, he will
receive the unpleasant object as well; he might have akusala vipaaka
through the ear. Whether the words are addressed to him or to someone
else does not make any difference.</p>

<p>

A. Is it right that the vipaaka might not be as unpleasant for him as
for the person to whom the harsh words are addressed?</p>

<p>

B. Is it necessary to have aversion every time we hear an unpleasant
sound?</p>

<p>

A. No, it is not necessary.</p>

<p>

B. Aversion has nothing to do with vipaaka. Considering whether the
words are addressed to oneself or to another person and the unpleasant
feelings about it are no longer vipaaka. If we feel aversion there are
akusala cittas, conditioned by our accumulations of aversion in the
past. There are some short moments of vipaaka only at the moment we
receive the sound, before the unpleasant feelings arise. Kamma
conditioned the vipaakacittas right at that moment. Kamma is the real
cause of vipaaka, not this or that person. If we want to have the right
understanding of vipaaka, we should not think in terms of "I," "those
people" and "harsh words." If we think of people and if we consider
whether harsh words are addressed to ourselves or to someone else, we
will not see the truth. If we think in terms of cittas and if we
understand conditions for cittas, we will understand reality. When
someone speaks harsh words it is conditioned by his accumulated
aversion. It is not really important whether he addresses those words
to us or to someone else.</p>

<p>

If we understand vipaaka we will take the unpleasant experiences of
life less seriously. It will be of much help to us and to other people
if we try to understand ourselves, if we know different cittas arising
at different moments. After we have had akusala vipaaka we should try
not to think much about it. When we think about vipaaka it already
belongs to the past. It is therefore better to forget about it
immediately.</p>

<p>

A. I still do not understand why I have to receive harsh words in
return for my kindness. How can the result of kusala kamma be akusala
vipaaka?</p>

<p>

B. This could never happen. Kusala kamma has kusala vipaaka as its
result; however, the good result might arise later on. It is not
possible to tell at which moments akusala kamma and kusala kamma
produce results. Akusala vipaaka is not the result of one's
kindness; it is the result of one's accumulated akusala
kamma.
Kindness will certainly bring a good result, but that might take place
later on.</p>

<p>

A. I cannot help feeling sorry for myself when there is akusala
vipaaka. What can I do to prevent the accumulation of more
unwholesomeness?</p>

<p>

B. When there are conditions for akusala cittas we cannot prevent their
arising. They arise very closely after the vipaaka, before we know it.
They are "anattaa," they do not belong to a "self." However, we can
develop more understanding of the different phenomena that arise. The
akusala cittas that arise after the vipaaka are not the same as the
vipaakacittas and they have conditions different from the conditions
for the vipaakacittas.</p>

<p>

If we understand that feeling sorry for ourselves and blaming other
people is done by akusala cittas and that in this way we accumulate
more unwholesomeness, we will be less inclined to do so. If we
understand that at this moment we cannot do anything about the vipaaka
which has its cause in the past, we will be able to forget about it
more easily. At the moment we are aware of akusala vipaaka, it has
fallen away already and belongs to the past.</p>

<p>

Life is too short to waste energy in worrying about things of the past.
It is better to accumulate kusala kamma by doing wholesome deeds.</p>

<p>

We read in the Kindred Sayings (Sa.myutta Nikaaya I, Sagaathaa Vagga,
Ch. III, Kosala, 111, &sect;5) that King Pasenadi came to see the
Buddha at Saavatthi. The king had been zealously busy with all such
matters as occupy kings. The Buddha asked him what he would do if he
would hear from loyal men, coming from all four directions, about a
great mountain, high as the sky, moving along and crushing every living
thing. The Buddha said:</p>

<p>

"And you, sire, seized with mighty dread, the destruction of human life
so terrible, rebirth as man so hard to obtain, what is there that you
could do?"</p>

<p>

"In such a mighty peril, lord, the destruction of human life so
terrible, rebirth as man so hard to obtain, what else could I do save
to live righteously and justly and work good and meritorious deeds?"</p>

<p>

"I tell you, sire, I make known to you sire: old age and death come
rolling in upon you, sire! Since old age and death are rolling in upon
you, sire, what is there that you can do?"</p>

<p>

"Since old age and death, lord, are rolling in upon me, what else can I
do save to live righteously and justly, and to work good and
meritorious deeds?"</p>

<p class="hd">II</p>

<p>A.
I
understand that the active side of our life consists of unwholesome
states of mind or akusala cittas and wholesome states of mind or kusala
cittas. Akusala cittas can perform unwholesome deeds and kusala cittas
can perform wholesome deeds. All through one's life one
accumulates both unwholesomeness and wholesomeness.</p>

<p>

There are other cittas which are the result of one's deeds:
those
are called vipaakacittas. The result of unwholesome deeds or akusala
kamma is akusala vipaaka; the result of wholesome deeds or kusala kamma
is kusala vipaaka. Vipaaka is the passive side of our life; we undergo
vipaaka. Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling through body
contact are vipaaka.</p>

<p>

I can understand this because sense-impressions are impressions which
one undergoes. The cittas which think about those impressions, and
which like or dislike them, are no longer result or vipaaka; they are
cause. They are akusala or kusala cittas. But I still doubt every time
I see there is the result of akusala or kusala kamma I did in the past.
Can you prove this to me?</p>

<p>

B. This cannot be proven in theory. One can know the truth only through
direct experience.</p>

<p>

There are three kinds of wisdom. The first kind stems from thinking
about the realities of life such as impermanence, old age, sickness and
death. The second kind is understanding developed through the study of
the Buddhist teachings. The third kind of wisdom is the direct
experience of the truth.</p>

<p>

The first and the second kind of wisdom are necessary, but they are
still theoretical understanding; they are not yet the realization of
the truth. If one accepts the Buddha's teachings because they
seem to be reasonable, or if one accepts them on the authority of the
Buddha, one will not have the clear understanding that stems from the
direct experience of the truth. Only this kind of understanding can
eliminate all doubts.</p>

<p>

We read in the Gradual Sayings (A"nguttara Nikaaya, Book of the Threes,
Ch. VII, &sect;65, Those of Kesaputta) that when the Buddha was
staying
in Kesaputta the Kaalaamas came to see him. They had heard different
views expounded by different people and had doubts as to who was
speaking the truth and who falsehood. The Buddha said:</p>

<p>

"Now look you, Kaalaamas. Be not misled by report or tradition or
hearsay. Be not misled by proficiency in the collections, nor by mere
logic or inference, nor after considering reasons, nor after reflection
on and approval of some theory, nor because it fits becoming, nor out
of respect for a recluse (who holds it). But, Kaalaamas, when you know
for yourselves: These things are unprofitable, these things are
blameworthy, these things are censured by the intelligent; these
things, when performed and undertaken, conduce to loss and
sorrow&mdash;then indeed do you reject them, Kaalaamas."</p>

<p>

The Buddha then asked the Kaalaamas whether greed, malice and delusion,
and the evil deeds they inspire, lead to a man's profit or to
his
loss. The Kaalaamas answered that they lead to his loss. The Buddha
then repeated that when they know for themselves that these things are
unprofitable and lead to sorrow, they should reject them. Thereupon the
Buddha spoke about non-greed, non-hate and non-delusion, and the
abstinence from evil deeds these inspire. He said that when the
Kaalaamas know for themselves that these things are profitable and
conduce to happiness, they should undertake them.</p>

<p>

We have to find out the truth ourselves, by experiencing it in daily
life. In being aware of all realities of daily life one develops the
third kind of wisdom.</p>

<p>

In the practice of vipassanaa or "insight," we learn to understand all
realities of daily life, in being aware of them at the moment they
occur. We learn to be aware of what happens at the present moment. We
will know what seeing, hearing, thinking, etc., really are if we are
aware of those realities at the moment they occur. Only the present
moment can give us the truth, not the past or the future. We cannot
experience now the cittas we had in the past; we cannot experience the
cittas which performed akusala kamma or kusala kamma in the past. We
can only experience cittas of the present moment. We can experience
that some cittas are akusala, some are kusala, and some are neither,
that they have different functions. If we learn to experience the
cittas of the present moment, we will gradually be able to see
realities more clearly. If we realize enlightenment, or the experience
of Nibbaana, all doubts about realities will be eliminated. Then we
will see the truth.</p>

<p>

A. I would like to be enlightened in order to know the truth.</p>

<p>

B. If you only have wishful thinking about Nibbaana, you will never
attain it. The path leading to Nibbaana is knowing the present moment.
Only if we know the present moment will we be able to eliminate
ignorance about realities and the idea of "self" to which we are still
clinging. We should not cling to a result which might take place in the
future. We should instead try to know the present moment.</p>

<p>

A. Is it not possible for me to know whether seeing and hearing at this
moment is akusala vipaaka or kusala vipaaka?</p>

<p>

B. Sometimes you can find out. For instance, hearing is kusala vipaaka
when the sound is produced by kusala cittas. Someone who speaks to you
with compassion, produces the sound with kusala cittas. When you hear
that sound there is kusala vipaaka. Often it is not possible for us to
know whether there is akusala vipaaka or kusala vipaaka. Moreover, it
is not of great use to know this, because we cannot do anything about
our own vipaaka.</p>

<p>

It is enough to know that akusala kamma brings about akusala vipaaka,
and that kusala kamma brings about kusala vipaaka. It is important to
remember that vipaaka is caused by our own kamma, that the cause of
vipaaka is within ourselves and not outside ourselves.</p>

<p>

The Gradual Sayings (A"nguttara Nikaaya, Book of the Threes, Ch. IV,
&sect;35, The Lord of Death) tells of a man who had been negligent
in
the doing of good deeds, and was brought before Yama, the lord of
death. Yama said to him:</p>

<p>

"My good man, it was through negligence that you did not act nobly in
deed, word and thought. Verily they shall do unto you in accordance
with your negligence. That evil action of yours was not done by mother,
father, brother, sister, friends and comrades: not by kinsmen, devas,
recluses and brahmins. By yourself alone was it done. It is just you
that will experience the fruit thereof."</p>

<p>

It is not important to know exactly at which moment there is akusala
vipaaka or kusala vipaaka. However, it is most important to know
exactly at which moments there is vipaaka and at which moments we
perform akusala kamma or kusala kamma. The moments we perform akusala
kamma and kusala kamma will condition our future.</p>

<p>

A. In order to know how and when one accumulates akusala kamma and
kusala kamma one should know more about the cittas which perform kamma.
I notice that the Buddha spoke about cittas in order to help people to
have more understanding about their life and in order to encourage them
to perform kusala kamma. Therefore I think that all through
one's
life one should develop a clear understanding about cittas. Could you
give me a definition of a citta?</p>

<p>

B. It is not possible to give a definition that will explain to you
what a citta is. You should experience cittas yourself in order to know
them. There are so many different types of cittas at different moments
that it is impossible to give one definition for all of them. The most
general definition is: it knows something. Citta is not like
materiality, which does not know anything. The citta which sees knows
colour, a citta which hears knows sound, a citta which thinks knows
many different objects.</p>

<p>

A. Why are seeing and hearing cittas? You explained before that seeing
is not thinking, but only the experience of colour through eye-sense
and that hearing is the experience of sound through ear-sense. Are
those not merely physical processes instead of cittas which know
something?</p>

<p>

B. Eye-sense and ear-sense in themselves are not cittas, they are
physical organs. But eye-sense and ear-sense are conditions for the
arising of cittas. There is citta whenever an object, as for example
colour or sound, is experienced. We should try to be aware of the citta
of the present moment if we want to know what citta is. We should be
aware of the seeing or the hearing that occurs right now.</p>

<p>

Many people who are brought up in the West do not understand why it is
not possible to give a clear definition of citta, and of everything the
Buddha taught. They want to prove things in theory. This is not the way
to find the truth. One should experience the truth in order to know it.</p>

<p>

A. I still think of citta as a mind which directs seeing, hearing,
thinking, etc. How can I find out that there is not a "self" which
directs everything?</p>

<p>

B. We can only find this out by being aware of different cittas. Thus
we will experience that we cannot direct our thoughts. We are
absent-minded when we do not want to be so, many odd thoughts arise, in
spite of ourselves. Where is the self that can direct our thoughts?</p>

<p>

There is one citta at a time; it arises and falls away completely, to
be followed by the next citta, which is no longer the same. There is no
single citta which stays. For example, seeing-consciousness is one
citta, but hearing-consciousness is another citta.</p>

<p>

A. I don't understand why those functions are performed by
different cittas. Why can't there be one citta which stays
and
performs different functions, and why is it not possible that different
functions are performed at the same time? I can see, hear and think at
the same time.</p>

<p>

B. Seeing occurs if colour contacts the eye-sense. Recognizing it or
thinking about it occurs afterwards. Seeing is not performed by the
same cittas as thinking about what one saw; seeing has different
conditions. Hearing has again different conditions. Thinking about what
one heard has conditions that are different from the conditions for
hearing-consciousness.</p>

<p>

You would not be able to notice that seeing and hearing are different
if those functions were performed by one single citta at the same time.
In that case you would only receive one impression instead of several
impressions. We experience seeing and hearing as different impressions,
even when they seem to occur at the same time. They have different
places of origin and different objects, and they occur at different
moments, though the moments can be so close that they seem to be one.
Thinking about what one just saw occurs after the seeing-consciousness,
thinking about what one just heard occurs after the
hearing-consciousness. Seeing-consciousness occurs at a moment
different from the moment the hearing-consciousness occurs. Therefore
thinking about what one saw cannot arise at the same moment as thinking
about what one heard. Thinking is done by many different cittas which
succeed one another.</p>

<p>

When we have learned to be more keenly aware of the citta which arises
at the present moment, we will notice that seeing and hearing arise
alternately, at different moments. We will notice that there
isn't one long moment of thinking, but different moments of
thinking.</p>

<p>

We will notice that thinking is very often interrupted by moments of
seeing and hearing, and these again are conditions for new thoughts. We
will find out how much our thoughts depend on different experiences of
the past, on unwholesome and wholesome tendencies we have accumulated,
on the objects we see and hear and on many other conditions.</p>

<p>

A. You said that all cittas are beyond control, that they are
"anattaa." Akusala cittas and kusala cittas are conditioned by
one's accumulations. It is not in anyone's power
that they
arise. You said that vipaakacittas are "anattaa" as well.</p>

<p>

Sometimes it seems that I can have power over vipaaka, that it is in my
power to have kusala vipaaka through the ear. Whenever I wish to hear a
pleasant sound, I can put a record of classical music on my
record-player.</p>

<p>

B. You put the record on because you know the conditions for the
pleasant sound. Everything happens when there are the right conditions
for it. It is impossible for anything to happen without conditions.
When there is fire we use water to extinguish it. We cannot order the
fire to be extinguished. We don't have to tell the water to
extinguish the fire; the water has the characteristic that it can
extinguish the fire. Without the right conditions we would not be able
to do anything.</p>

<p>

With regard to the beautiful music which you can play, there have to be
many different conditions for this pleasant sound. And even when there
is this pleasant sound, you have no power over the kusala
vipaakacittas. If you really could direct them, you could make them
arise at any moment, even without the record-player. We should remember
that music is not vipaaka, only the cittas which experience the
pleasant object through the ear are vipaaka. Do we really have power
over these cittas?</p>

<p>

There are many conditions which have to cooperate so that the vipaaka
can arise. There has to be ear-sense. Did you create your own
ear-sense? You received ear-sense before you were born; this also is a
result for which you did not ask. Moreover, do you think that you can
have kusala vipaaka as long as you wish and whenever you wish? When you
have developed a keener awareness you will notice that the kusala
vipaaka and the other types of cittas arise alternately.</p>

<p>

The vipaakacittas are followed by cittas which are no longer vipaaka,
for example, the cittas which arise when you like the music which you
hear and when you think about it. Or there might be cittas which think
about many different things, perhaps with aversion or with worry. Or
there might be thoughts of kindness towards other people.</p>

<p>

The kusala vipaaka will not only be interrupted by akusala cittas and
kusala cittas, but by akusala vipaaka as well. There is akusala vipaaka
when there are loud noises outside, when the telephone rings loudly, or
when one feels the sting of a mosquito. There cannot be kusala vipaaka
at the moment there is an akusala citta, a kusala citta or akusala
vipaaka.</p>

<p>

If you could make kusala vipaaka arise at will, you could have it
without interruption, whenever you wish. This is not possible.
Moreover, if it were not the right time for you to have any kusala
vipaaka, you would not be able to receive a pleasant object: the
record-player would be broken, or something else would happen so that
you could not have kusala vipaaka.</p>

<p>

A. Is it not by accident that the record-player would be broken?</p>

<p>

B. The Buddha taught that everything happens because of conditions.
There are no accidents. You will understand reality more deeply if you
think of cittas, and if you do not think of conventional terms like
record-player, this person or that person. Vipaaka are the cittas, not
the record-player or the sound in itself. The record-player is only one
of the many conditions for vipaaka. The real cause of vipaaka is not an
accident, or a cause outside ourselves; the real cause is within
ourselves.</p>

<p>

Can you find another cause for akusala vipaaka but your own akusala
kamma, and for kusala vipaaka but your own kusala kamma?</p>

<p>

A. That is right, I can find no other cause. However, I still do not
understand how akusala cittas which performed akusala kamma in the past
and kusala cittas which performed kusala kamma in the past can produce
vipaaka later on.</p>

<p>

B. It is not possible to understand how the events of our life are
interrelated without studying cittas in detail and without knowing and
experiencing the cittas which arise at the present moment. When one can
experience what the cittas of the present moment really are, one will
be able to understand more about the past.</p>

<p>

When the Buddha became enlightened he saw how everything that happens
in life has many conditions and he saw how things that happen depend on
one another.</p>

<p>

The teaching about the conditional arising of phenomena, the dependent
origination (pa.ticca-samuppaada), is difficult to grasp. We read in
the Kindred Sayings (Sa.myutta Nikaaya I, Sagaathaa Vagga, Ch. VI, The
Brahmaa Suttas, Ch. 1, &sect;1, The Entreaty) that the Buddha, when
he
was staying at Uruvela after he had just attained enlightenment, was
thinking that the Dhamma he had penetrated was deep, difficult to
understand:</p>

<p>And
for a race devoting itself to the things to which it clings, devoted
thereto, delighting therein, this were a matter hard to perceive, to
wit, that this is conditioned by that&mdash;that all that happens
is by
way of cause.</p>

<p>At
first
the Buddha had no inclination to teach Dhamma, as he knew that a
teaching which is "against the stream of common thought" would not be
accepted by people who delight in clinging. The sutta continues:</p>

<p>"This that through many toils I've won,<br>

Enough! Why should I make it known?<br>

By folk with lust and hate consumed<br>

Not this a Dhamma that can be grasped<br>

Against the stream (of common thought),<br>

Deep, subtle, fine, and hard to see,<br>

Unseen it will be by passion's slaves,<br>

Cloaked in the murk (of ignorance)."</p>

<p>However,
the Buddha decided out of compassion to teach Dhamma, for the sake of
those who would be able to understand it. Do you still have doubts
about the accumulation of deeds?</p>

<p>

A. Is the deed you see a mental phenomenon or a physical phenomenon?</p>

<p>

B. You can only see the action of the body, but the action is actually
performed by cittas. We can never see the citta, but we can find out
what the citta is like when the body moves in doing deeds. With regard
to your question how deeds done in the past can produce a result later
on, the answer is that deeds are performed by cittas. They are
mentality and thus they can be accumulated. All experiences and deeds
of the past are accumulated in each citta, which falls away and
conditions the next citta. Whenever there is the right condition the
kamma that is accumulated and carried on from one moment of citta to
the next can produce vipaaka.</p>

<p class="hd">III</p>

<p>A.
I would like to know if we only receive vipaaka in this life, or is
there vipaaka in a future life as well?</p>

<p>

B. According to the Buddhist teachings one receives the results of
one's deeds in future lives as well. We read in the Kindred
Sayings (Sa.myutta Nikaaya I, Ch. III, Kosala, 2, &sect;10,
Childless
2) that when the Buddha was staying at Saavatthi, King Pasenadi came to
see him. A rich man who had lived as a miser had just died. He had
performed both good deeds and bad deeds and he therefore had to receive
both kusala vipaaka and akusala vipaaka, which he experienced during
different lifespans. He had given alms to a "Silent Buddha"l of a
former period, but afterwards he regretted his gift. As a result of his
good deed of almsgiving to a Silent Buddha he was reborn seven times in
heaven, where he could enjoy pleasant vipaaka. After his existences in
heaven he was reborn as a human being, which is kusala vipaaka as well.
He was born from rich parents, but his accumulation of stinginess
prevented him from enjoying the pleasant things of life. Because he
regretted his gift to the Silent Buddha, as a result he did not utilize
his riches for himself or for others.</p>

<p>

After his existence as a human being he was again bound for a different
rebirth. He had committed akusala kamma of a heavy kind and this
akusala kamma would bring akusala vipaaka of a heavy kind. He had
killed the only son of his brother because he wanted to get his
brother's fortune. This very heavy kamma caused him to be
reborn
in hell where he would stay for many hundred thousands of years. The
sutta points out how one can receive different results in different
existences.</p>

<p>

A. Is the existence of heavens and hells not mere mythology?</p>

<p>

B. People have different accumulated inclinations which make them
perform different kamma. No person acts in the same way as another.
Each act brings its own result, either in this life or in the following
existences. To be reborn in a heavenly plane or in the human plane is
the result of a wholesome deed, to be reborn in a sorrowful plane is
the result of an unwholesome deed. Heaven and hell are conventional
terms which are used to explain realities. They explain the nature of
the vipaaka which is caused by kamma. Since both akusala kamma and
kusala kamma have different degrees, akusala vipaaka and kusala vipaaka
must have different degrees as well.</p>

<p>

Names are given to different heavenly planes and different sorrowful
planes in order to point out the different degrees of akusala vipaaka
and kusala vipaaka. Deva, which means "radiant being," is a name given
to those who are born in heavenly planes. In the Anuruddha Sutta
(Middle Length Sayings III, No. 127) Anuruddha spoke about different
degrees of skill in meditation which bring their results accordingly. A
monk who was not advanced was reborn as a deva "with tarnished light."
Those who were more advanced in meditation were reborn as devas with a
greater radiance. There are different devas with different degrees of
brightness.</p>

<p>

A. I find it difficult to believe in devas and in different planes of
existence.</p>

<p>

B. You do not experience devas and different planes of existence right
at this moment. But is it right to reject what you cannot experience
yet? If one has right understanding of the cittas of the present moment
one will be able to understand more about the past and about the future.</p>

<p>

Rebirth-consciousness can arise in any plane of existence. When the
right conditions are present a good or a bad deed which has been
accumulated can produce a result, it can produce rebirth-consciousness
in the appropriate plane.</p>

<p>

A. What is the first vipaaka in this life?</p>

<p>

B. There has to be a citta at the very first moment of life. Without a
citta we cannot have life. A dead body has no citta, it is not alive.
What type of citta would be the first citta? Would it be an akusala
citta or a kusala citta, thus a type of citta which could bring a
result? Or would it be another type of citta, for example, a citta
which is not a cause but a result, a vipaakacitta?</p>

<p>

A. I think it must be a vipaakacitta. To be born is a result; nobody
asks to be born. Why are people born with such different characters and
in such different situations? Are the parents the only cause of birth
and the only cause of the character of a child?</p>

<p>

B. Parents are only one of the conditions for the body of a child, but
they are not the only condition.</p>

<p>

A. What about the character of a child? Are there not certain
tendencies in a child's character he inherits from his
parents?
Is this not proved by science?</p>

<p>

B. The character of a child cannot be explained by the character of the
parents. Brothers and sisters and even twins can be very different. One
child likes to study, another child is lazy; one child is by nature
cheerful, another depressed. Parents may have influence on a
child's character after its birth in that education, a
cultural
pattern or a family tradition in which a child is brought up will be
conditions for cittas to arise. But a child does not inherit its
character from its parents. The differentiations in character are
caused by accumulations of experiences from previous existences as well.</p>

<p>

A. Are parents not the real cause of birth?</p>

<p>

B. Parents are only one of the conditions for birth; kamma is the real
cause of birth. A deed, done in the past, brings its result when it is
the right time: it can produce the vipaakacitta which is
rebirth-consciousness. We read in the "Discourse on the Lesser Analysis
of Deeds" (Middle Length Sayings III, No. 135) that, when the Buddha
was staying near Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove, Subha came to see him and
said:</p>

<p>

"Now, good Gotama, what is the cause, what the reason that lowness and
excellence are to be seen among human beings while they are in human
form? For, good Gotama, human beings of short life-span are to be seen
and those of long life-span; those of many and those of few illnesses;
those who are ugly, those who are beautiful; those who are of little
account, those who are of great account; those who are poor, those who
are wealthy; those who are of lowly families, those of high families;
those who are weak in wisdom, those who are full of wisdom. Now what,
good Gotama, is the cause, what the reason that lowness and excellence
are to be seen among human beings while they are in human form?"</p>

<p>

"Deeds are one's own, brahman youth, beings are heirs to
deeds,
deeds are matrix, deeds are kin, deeds are arbiters. Deed divides
beings, that is to say by lowness and excellence."</p>

<p>

A. Is rebirth in a human plane the same as reincarnation?</p>

<p>

B. If there were reincarnation, a soul or "self" would continue to
exist and it would take on another body in the next life. However,
there is no soul or "self." There are cittas which succeed one another
from birth to death, from this life to the next life. One citta has
completely fallen away when the next citta arises. There can be only
one citta at a time, and there is no citta which lasts.</p>

<p>

Cittas arise and fall away completely, succeeding one another. Death is
the conventional word for the end of one's lifespan on a
plane of
existence, but actually there is birth and death at each moment of
one's life, when a citta arises and falls away. There
isn't
any citta one can take for a soul or "self." Since there is no soul or
"self" in this life, how could there be a soul or "self" which is
reborn in the next life? The last citta of this life is the
dying-consciousness. The dying-consciousness arises and falls away, and
it is succeeded by the rebirth-consciousness of the next life. The
rebirth-consciousness is conditioned by the previous citta, the
dying-consciousness, but it is not the same citta.</p>

<p>

A. I can see tendencies in people's character which seem to
be
the same all through their lives. Moreover, there is rebirth in the
next life. Therefore there must be continuity in life. However, I do
not understand how there can be continuity if each citta completely
falls away before the next citta arises.</p>

<p>

B. There is continuity because each citta conditions the next citta and
thus accumulated tendencies can be carried on from one moment to the
next moment. All accumulations of past existences and of the present
life condition future existences.</p>

<p>

When people asked the Buddha whether it is the same person who is
reborn or another person, the Buddha answered that it is neither the
same person nor another person. There is nobody who stays the same, not
even in this life, because there is no "self." On the other hand, it is
not another person who is reborn, because there is continuity. Former
existences condition this life, and this life also conditions the
following lives.</p>

<p>

A. What is the last vipaaka in this life?</p>

<p>

B. The dying-consciousness (cuti-citta) is the last vipaaka in this
life.</p>

<p>

Since there are many deeds which have not yet produced a result, one of
the deeds will produce rebirth-consciousness after death. As long as
there is kamma there will be vipaaka, continuing on and on. There will
be future lives, so that the results of one's deeds can be
received.</p>

<p>

When the dying-consciousness falls away, a deed of the past, or kamma,
immediately produces a vipaakacitta: the rebirth-consciousness of the
next life. When the dying-consciousness has fallen away, the
rebirth-consciousness follows upon it immediately, and thus all that
has been accumulated is carried on from the past into the next life.</p>

<p>

A. What causes the rebirth-consciousness of the next life?</p>

<p>

B. Everyone has performed akusala kamma and kusala kamma. Each deed
brings its own result. The vipaakacitta which is the
rebirth-consciousness can therefore only be the result of one deed, of
akusala kamma or of kusala kamma.</p>

<p>

A. Is birth in the human plane the result of kusala kamma?</p>

<p>

B. Birth in the human plane is always the result of kusala kamma.
Akusala vipaaka which arises afterwards in life is the result of kamma
that is different from the good deed that produced the
rebirth-consciousness. After birth in the human plane there can be many
moments of akusala vipaaka, every time one experiences an unpleasant
object through one of the five senses. Those moments are the result of
other unwholesome deeds performed in the past.</p>

<p>

If the rebirth-consciousness is akusala vipaaka one cannot be born as a
human being. The rebirth has to take place in another plane of
existence, such as the animal world or one of the woeful planes like
the hells or the ghost realm.</p>

<p>

A. Can a human being be reborn as an animal?</p>

<p>

B. Some people behave like animals, how could they be reborn as human
beings? Everyone will receive the result of his deeds accordingly.</p>

<p>

A. Is it due to one's kamma that one is born in favourable
circumstances, for instance, in a royal family or in a rich family?</p>

<p>

B. Yes, this is due to a wholesome deed performed in the past.</p>

<p>

A. I notice that even people who are born in the same circumstances, as
for example in rich families, are very different. Some rich people are
generous, others are stingy. How could this be explained?</p>

<p>

B. People are different because they have different accumulated
inclinations and tendencies which cause them to behave in different
ways. We read in the sutta that I quoted above about the person who was
born from rich parents, but who could not enjoy the pleasant things of
life because of his accumulated stinginess. Although he had the
opportunity to let other people share in his fortune he did not want to
do this. Other people again who have received pleasant things in life
grasp every opportunity to give things away to others. The different
inclinations people have accumulated condition them to do unwholesome
deeds which will bring them unpleasant results, or to do wholesome
deeds which will bring them pleasant results. People take different
attitudes towards vipaaka. The attitude one takes towards vipaaka is
more important than vipaaka itself, because one's attitude
conditions one's life in the future.</p>

<p>

A. Can kusala vipaaka be a condition for happiness?</p>

<p>

B. The things which are pleasant for the five senses cannot guarantee
true and lasting happiness. Rich people who have everything that is
pleasant for the five senses can still be very unhappy. For instance,
when one is sitting in a beautiful garden with sweet-smelling flowers
and singing birds, one can still be very depressed. At the moment one
is depressed the cittas are akusala cittas. One cannot always be happy
with pleasant things around. Unhappiness and happiness depend on
one's accumulations of unwholesomeness and wholesomeness.</p>

<p>

If one feels unhappy it is due to one's own defilements.
Unpleasant feeling is conditioned by attachment. If one does not get
what one wants one feels unhappy. If one has no attachment at all there
would be no unhappiness. One can be perfectly happy if one is purified
from defilements.</p>

<p>

We read in the Gradual Sayings (A"nguttara Nikaaya, Book of the Threes,
Ch. IV, &sect;34, Of Alavi) that when the Buddha was staying near
Alavi, Hatthaka was wandering there and saw the Buddha seated on the
ground strewn with leaves. He asked the Buddha:</p>

<p>

"Pray, sir, does the Exalted One live happily?"</p>

<p>

"Yes, my lad, I live happily. I am one of those who live happily in the
world."</p>

<p>

"But, sir, the winter nights are cold, the dark half of the month is
the time of snowfall. Hard is the ground trampled by the hoofs of
cattle, thin the carpet of fallen leaves, sparse are the leaves of the
tree, cold are the saffron robes and cold the gale of wind that blows."</p>

<p>

Then said the Exalted One: "Still, my lad, I live happily. Of those who
live happily in the world I am one."</p>

<p>

The Buddha then pointed out that a man who had a house with a gabled
roof, well-fitting doors, "a long-fleeced woollen rug, a beautiful bed,
four beautiful wives," could have lust, malice and delusion.
Defilements will cause "torments of body or of mind," defilements are
the cause of unhappiness. The Buddha had eradicated all defilements
completely, and thus it was not important to him whether there was
akusala vipaaka or kusala vipaaka. He could live perfectly happy no
matter what the circumstance were.</p>

<p>

A. How can we purify ourselves so that we take the right attitude
towards vipaaka?</p>

<p>

B. We can purify ourselves only if we know the cause of defilements.
The cause of all defilements is ignorance. Out of ignorance we believe
in a "self," we cling to a "self." Ignorance conditions attachment and
aversion or anger, it causes all unhappiness in the world. Ignorance
can only be cured by wisdom. In vipassanaa or "insight meditation" the
wisdom is developed which can gradually eradicate the belief in a
"self." Only when this wrong belief has been completely eradicated can
all defilements be eradicated stage by stage.</p>

<p>

The Arahat, the perfected one who has attained the final stage of
enlightenment, has eradicated all defilements. He has no more
attachment, ill-will or ignorance. As he has no defilements he is
perfectly happy. After he has passed away there will be no more vipaaka
for him in a future life, there will be no more rebirth for him.</p>

<p>

In the "Discourse on the Analysis of the Elements" (Middle Length
Sayings III, No. 140) we read that the Buddha taught Dhamma to
Pukkusaati when they were staying in the potter's dwelling.
The
Buddha taught him about physical phenomena and mental phenomena and he
taught the mental development which leads to Arahatship. The Arahat
does not cling to life. In order to describe the state of the Arahat
the Buddha used the simile of the oil-lamp which burns on account of
oil and wick but which goes out if the oil and wick come to an end. It
is the same with the conditions for rebirth. So long as there are
defilements there will be fuel for rebirth. When defilements have been
eradicated completely there is no more fuel left for rebirth. The sutta
goes on to say that the highest wisdom of those who have attained
enlightenment is the "knowledge of the complete destruction of anguish."</p>

<p>

The knowledge or wisdom developed in vipassanaa leads to Nibbaana,
which is the end of all sorrow.</p>

<a name="KammaandFreedom"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Kamma and Freedom</a></p>

 <p class="author">Francis Story</p>


<p>The
problems encountered in relating the Buddhist doctrine of kamma to the
issue of causality and freedom are largely ones of meaning. They
particularly revolve around the meaning of such concepts as causation,
conditioning, and determination. Buddhism does not deny that man is
largely conditioned by his circumstances and environment. But the
conditioning is not absolute. It may almost amount to determinism, and
the margin of free-will may be very slight indeed, but it is always
present. In Buddhist ethico-psychology great importance is given to the
thought-moment of choice&mdash;that moment of conscious response to
a
situation in which we are free to act in a number of different ways.
Now it may happen that the predominant propensities of the past impel
almost irresistibly towards a particular course of action; but it must
be remembered that our past habits of thought and deed are never all of
the same kind. Human character is very fluid, and in the critical
moment it is never absolutely certain what kind of urge will come
uppermost. The whole point of any character development is to
systematically cultivate the good urges and eradicate the bad ones.</p>

<p>

Then again, some precise definition of the specifically Buddhist terms
is necessary, in order to grasp what is meant by kamma. Kamma is simply
action, a deed. Its result is called vipaaka, and the two should not be
confused or telescoped into a single concept under the same word, as is
done by Theosophists and some popular writers on Hinduism. But the two
terms considered together, as kamma-vipaaka, "action-and-result," do
denote a moral principle in the universal order. Thus a cruel action,
because its genesis is mental (cetanaa), will in course of time ripen
as a painful experience of a similar kind for the same person who did
the cruel deed&mdash;perhaps in this life (the murderer who is
hanged)
or in a subsequent one.</p>

<p>

As to whether it is the same person who experiences the result, that
can neither be absolutely affirmed nor absolutely denied; its answer
lies in the concept of personality and identity held by Buddhism, which
can be found in writings dealing with rebirth. The sole identity that
can be claimed for a personality, even through the course of one
lifetime, is the world-line represented by his kammic continuity. While
an individual at any given moment is simply the end-result of what his
previous actions have made him, he is also projecting himself into the
future by his present acts, and it is in these that his freedom of
choice lies. He is no more determined absolutely by his own past than
he is by his environment or his heredity. Buddhism teaches the
principle of multiple causality: that is to say, every phenomenon is
the product of more than one cause. And the will, although it is
greatly modified by these causes, is itself free to choose between a
number of different causes operating upon it from the past. We are free
to select the causes that will determine our action in the moment of
choice. That is why conflicts arise which are sometimes so difficult
and painful to resolve. There is always the existential anguish in
freedom of choice.</p>

<p>

At any time we can see how this works out in concrete instances. A man
may have been reared in an atmosphere of squalor, want and anxiety, in
which everything pushes towards crime. But in the moment of deciding
whether or not he shall commit a crime, other, perhaps latent, causes
are at work within him. He may have been taught earlier that crime is
morally wrong, or some good influence from a previous life may be
stirring within him, or he may have realized, quite simply, that "crime
does not pay." He may be deterred by some memory of a painful result,
imprisonment or flogging, from the present life. Whether these
deterrent factors are noble or ignoble, they are always present, and he
has to make a choice between the causes that will determine his present
action. And very often he will choose not to commit the crime. If this
were not so, the moral improvement of individuals and society would not
be possible.</p>

<p>

We might find it difficult to see that an individual born in an
environment of destitution, deprivation, ignorance, want and hunger can
be said to be born in such circumstances due to past evil deeds. But in
fact what we "cannot see" is precisely what the Buddha taught. All
attempts to reconstruct the Buddha's thought, leaving out
rebirth, are doomed to failure. We might be able to have rebirth
without the moral order represented by kamma-vipaaka&mdash;in which
case it would only be an infinite extension of the amoral, meaningless
life-process envisaged by the epiphenomenalists&mdash;but we cannot
have a moral order without rebirth.</p>

<p>

Why so? Simply because not all murderers get hanged! (And it may be
added, neither do they get punished who by their indifference,
selfishness and brutality help to make others criminals. At least, not
in the same life. Too often they prosper&mdash;but the principle of
kamma-vipaaka is never cheated. At some time they have to pay for it.)</p>

<p>

The world is so dominated today by the concepts of materialism that
some Buddhist Kierkegaard ought to write another Concluding
Unscientific Postscript to clear up the muddle. Not anti-scientific, be
it understood, but simply unscientific. Not bounded by the dogmas of
nineteenth century Darwin-Marx-Huxley materialism, which today is taken
for science. We should be ready to accept what is true in this
materialism, without fearing to go beyond it.</p>

<p>

And what is true in that concept of man? That he is conditioned by his
environment? Certainly: nobody in their senses would deny it, and the
Buddha did not. But no man is entirely conditioned by anything, not
even by his own accumulated habits of thinking and acting. No character
is irrevocably fixed&mdash;except that of an Ariya (saint), whose
destiny is assured. (It is necessary to make this exception, although
here it is something of a digression.) The ordinary man is, as I have
said, a fluid process; his identity from one moment to another is
nothing but the world-line of his continuity as a process in time.
Consequently he is always acting "out of character." Have not great and
noble men arisen from the most sordid environments of want and
deprivation? And conversely, have not criminals and degenerates
appeared where all the social, economic and even hereditary factors
were the most favourable that the world has to offer?</p>

<p>

Let it be granted that in the majority of cases men are what their
circumstances make them. Buddhism teaches that it is they who have
created these circumstances by their past kamma. But their present
kamma, which moulds their future, is in their own hands. However slight
the margin of free-will, it is always there. Without it, life would be
altogether without meaning, and it would be absurd to try to seek any
meaning. In fact, it would be impossible, and we ourselves would not be
puzzling over Buddhism! The mere fact that these questions have
presented themselves to us shows that we are not automatons, not just
cybernetic mechanisms, bound to run like a street car or a train along
set lines, but free-swimming organisms&mdash;thinking, willing
personalities, not plants.</p>

<p>

Kamma is not solely responsible for every phenomenon and every
experience. The physical aspects of life also have their share in the
totality. Still, in the last resort, the mind and will are able to
prevail over everything else. Not always by a single act of will, but
by repeated acts of the same nature, having the same final goal. Life
without suffering is impossible, because of the conditions, physical
and psychological, that our desire for personalized life imposes as the
condition of our being-in-the-world. But the mind can develop
itself&mdash;can stop creating and imposing those conditions.</p>

<p>

We must distinguish clearly between what we have to submit
to&mdash;the
circumstances of the present which we have made for ourselves by our
past actions&mdash;and the future we can make for ourselves by our
present thinking and doing. That distinction is most important: it
represents the whole difference between absolute determinism and
free-will. The root cause of phenomenal existence is the double one of
ignorance conjoined with craving, each being dependent upon the other.
When these two joint conditions are removed, all other conditioning
comes to an end. That is the whole point of pa.ticca-samuppaada, the
formula of conditioned arising&mdash;that it can be reversed by
repeated acts of decision. Man can always swim against the current; if
he could not, his evolution would be impossible.</p>

<p>

It should not be thought that, as a corollary of the above, Buddhism
approves of poverty, hunger and want. Buddhism approves of nothing in
the world except the striving to gain release from it. Its view of the
world is realistic. Poverty, hunger and ignorance exist in the world,
and they will continue to do so as long as people, by their own
infliction of these evils on others in previous lives, cause themselves
to be born in such circumstances. We should try to diminish these
evils, but it can never be done by purely physical means. The effort is
good merely because it represents a good volition which will bear fruit
in the future rather than because of any likelihood of its succeeding
completely. If all the world acted according to Buddhist principles of
unselfishness, generosity and compassion, there would be no more
deprivation, no more slums, no more oppression or exploitation of man
by man. Yet still, bad kamma of the past would have to produce its
vipaaka by some other means. We can be certain that if all the wealth
in the world were to be equally distributed one morning, there would be
the rich and the poor again by evening. It is a fundamental fact of
nature&mdash;which hates equality more than it hates a vacuum.
There
will be equality when all the past and present thoughts and deeds of
all men are equal&mdash;and when can that be?</p>

<p>

The economic structure of society accurately reflects man's
muddled, illogical and selfish nature. It will be changed only when
that nature is completely transformed. All improvement must come from
within, for "mind creates all phenomena" out of the raw material of the
universe. The world-stuff is neither good nor bad; it is
man's
thinking which makes heaven or hell out of it.</p>

<p>

The Buddha said: "In this fathom-long body, equipped with sense organs
and faculties, O bhikkhus, I declare to you is the world, the origin of
the world, the cessation of the world and the path leading to the
cessation thereof." Philosophically speaking, these words are the most
profound, most comprehensive and most illuminating ever uttered. We
create the world literally. The world, in turn, conditions us, but it
does not create us. That is the great difference. Since we, each of us
individually, are the creators of our world, even the conditioning it
imposes is ultimately traceable to ourselves.</p>

<a name="CollectiveKarma"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Collective Karma</a></p>

 <p class="author">Francis Story</p>

<p>From
time
to time the question of whether there is "collective karma," or not,
keeps coming up. Is it possible for groups of people&mdash;whole
nations or generations-&mdash;to share the same karma? Or is karma
a
strictly individual and personal thing?</p>

<p>

The Buddha treated karma, everywhere and always, as a personal
inheritance:</p>

<p>

Owners of their karma are the beings, heirs of their karma, their karma
is the womb from which they are born, their karma is their friend,
their refuge. Whatever karma they perform, good or bad, thereof they
will be the heirs.</p>

<p>

Majjhima Nikaaya, 135</p>

<p>

None can suffer from the karma of another, nor profit by the karma of
another. But it may happen that large groups of people, through being
guilty of the same misdeeds&mdash;as for instance racial
persecutions,
mass killings and tortures, etc.&mdash;come to make for themselves
almost identical karma. Can this be called "collective karma"?</p>

<p>

In a sense it can; yet the term is deceptive. The so-called "collective
karma" is made up of individual karmas, each of which must have its
individual fruition. No man necessarily shares the karma of others of
his national or other group simply by reason of being one of that
group. He is responsible only for his own particular share in its
deeds. If he does not share them, his own karma will be quite different.</p>

<p>

Most of the confusion of thought arises from the misuse of the phrase
"the law of karma"; and the spelling of the word betrays the source
from which the idea of a "law" of "collective karma" comes. The Pali
word is kamma.</p>

<p>

Kamma simply means "action"&mdash;a deed performed by bodily
action,
speech or thought. Its result is vipaaka. There is a law of causality,
and it is because of this law that kamma, the cause, is invariably
followed by vipaaka, the result. "The law of karma" has a mystical
sound, and suggests a kind of fatalism. People who say, resignedly, "It
is my karma," are using the word wrongly. They should say, "It is my
vipaaka." This would remind them that their kamma, the really important
thing, is under their control: they are fashioning it from moment to
moment. As their kamma is now, so will their vipaaka be in the future.
We should avoid confusing the cause with the effect.</p>

<p>

Kamma is individual because it is cetanaa&mdash;volitional action
of an individual mind.</p>

<p>

Volition, O bhikkhus, is what I call action; for through volition one
performs actions of body, speech and mind.</p>

<p>

A"nguttara Nikaaya, 6:63</p>

<p>

To what extent can one person dominate and direct the volition of
another? Sometimes to a very dangerous extent: but only if there is a
surrender of the will to the external influence. That itself involves
an act of cetanaa, a voluntary submission to another person's
will. Such a submission should only be made to a spiritual guru; and
even then the moral sense should not be suspended. The case of
A"ngulimaala is a warning against a too unquestioning submission to the
dictates of an unworthy teacher. A"ngulimaala was fortunate later in
encountering the greatest Teacher of all, who saved him. People of
today have to protect themselves against spiritual quacks, and it is
not always easy to discriminate.</p>

<p>

Apart from this, there is the question of indoctrination, a very great
problem in the modern world. We have seen the phenomenon, unknown
before in history, of whole nations behaving under a compulsion imposed
on them from without. We have seen the development of techniques for
manufacturing a mass-mind capable of incredible atrocities. Propaganda,
brain-washing, mass-suggestion leading to mass-hysteria&mdash;all
these
are features of the new technique of power. Can these produce
"collective karma"? The answer is that they can certainly produce
individual kammas that are practically identical; but they still remain
personal kammas, even though they are instigated. No matter to what
influences a man is subjected, his reaction to them together with its
vipaaka remains his own.</p>

<p>

But supposing (not, alas, a very far-fetched supposition these days) a
man is forced on pain of torture or death to participate in mass
atrocities?</p>

<p>

To begin with, it must be his past kamma that has placed him in such a
terrible position; it is his vipaaka from some previous unwholesome
kamma. He has two alternatives before him: either he can submit, and
for the sake of preserving his life continue to make more bad kamma for
himself&mdash;or he can refuse and let his enemies do what they
like.
If he chooses the latter course he will probably exhaust the bad
vipaaka in suffering, in his current life. His act of self-abnegation,
his refusal to participate in deeds of violence and cruelty, will be a
positive good. He will have perfected his siila, his moral purity.</p>

<p>

In either case his kamma, be it wholesome or unwholesome, will be his
own.</p>

<p>

But what about the sharing of merits? This again depends upon cetanaa,
an act of will. When a good deed is performed and the merit is shared
with others, there must be the will to share it on their part. By
approving the deed they produce a similar good cetanaa in themselves.
Their attention must be drawn to the deed, so that they can rejoice in
it and generate a good mental impulse connected with daana
(liberality), or whatever the meritorious deed may be. Again, the
"sharer" makes his own kamma. We cannot share demerit, because nobody
would be willing to share it with us!</p>

<p>

The troubles we inherit from our parents' mistakes cannot be
said
to be sufferings resulting from their kamma. A child that is born in a
country devastated by war, if it suffers it is suffering because the
situation in which it has been born makes it possible for the
child's own bad kamma to fructify. There must always be more
than
one cause to produce a given result. Another child, in precisely the
same situation, and whose parents were even more directly responsible
for the mistakes that led to the country's ruin, may be
materially in a much better position. Its parents may have made a
fortune in the war that brought others to destitution. This child, too,
is experiencing the results of its own kamma, not that of the parents.
They will have to suffer for theirs.</p>

<p>

There are different kinds of causes, and different kinds of effects.
Kamma is one kind of cause; vipaaka is its corresponding effect. The
important thing is to distinguish clearly between the individual cause
and effect that carries over from one life to another&mdash;the
personal kamma and vipaaka&mdash;and other chains of cause and
effect
that operate through circumstances in the external world.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="Reflections"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Reflections on Kamma and Its Fruit</a></p>

 <p class="author">Nyanaponika Thera</p>

<p class="hd">I</p>

<p>Most
writings on the doctrine of kamma emphasize the strict lawfulness
governing kammic action, ensuring a close correspondence between our
deeds and their fruits. While this emphasis is perfectly in place,
there is another side to the working of kamma&mdash;a side rarely
noted, but highly important. This is the modifiability of kamma, the
fact that the lawfulness which governs kamma does not operate with
mechanical rigidity but allows for a considerably wide range of
modifications in the ripening of the fruit. This fact is already
implied by those types of kamma called "supportive," "counteractive"
and "destructive," and by a classification referring to the different
ripening times of the result. But the teaching that kamma-results are
modifiable is so important that it deserves to be stressed and
discussed as an explicit theme in itself.</p>

<p>

If kammic action were always to bear fruits of invariably the same
magnitude, and if modification or annulment of kamma-result were
excluded, liberation from the sa.msaara cycle of suffering would be
impossible; for an inexhaustible past would ever throw up new
obstructive results of unwholesome kamma.</p>

<p>

Hence the Buddha said:</p>

<p>

"If one says that in whatever way a person performs a kammic action, in
that very same way he will experience the result&mdash;in that case
there will be no (possibility for a) religious life1 and no opportunity
would appear for the complete ending of suffering.</p>

<p>

"But if one says that a person who performs a kammic action (with a
result) that is variably experienceable, will reap its results
accordingly&mdash;in that case there will be (a possibility for) a
religious life and an opportunity for making a complete end of
suffering."</p>

<p>

A"nguttara Nikaaya, 3:110</p>

<p>

Like any physical event, the mental process constituting a kammic
action never exists in isolation but in a field, and thus its efficacy
in producing a result depends not only on its own potential, but also
upon the variable factors of its field, which can modify it in numerous
ways. We see, for example, that a particular kamma, either good or bad,
may sometimes have its result strengthened by supportive kamma,
weakened by counteractive kamma, or even annulled by destructive kamma.
The occurrence of the result can also be delayed if the conjunction of
outer circumstances required for its ripening is not complete; and that
delay may again give a chance for counteractive or destructive kamma to
operate.</p>

<p>

It is, however, not only these extraneous conditions which can cause
modification. The ripening also reflects the kamma's
"internal
field" or internal conditions&mdash;that is, the total qualitative
structure of the mind from which the action issues. To one rich in
moral or spiritual qualities, a single offence may not entail the
weighty results the same offence will have for one who is poor in such
protective virtues. Also, analogously to human law, a first
offender's punishment will be milder than that of a
reconvicted
criminal.</p>

<p>

Of this type of modified reaction the Buddha speaks in the continuation
of the discourse quoted above:</p>

<p>

"Now take the case when a minor evil deed has been committed by a
certain person and it takes him to hell. But if the same minor offence
is committed by another person, its result might be experienced during
his lifetime and not even the least (residue of a reaction) will appear
(in the future), not to speak about a major (reaction).</p>

<p>

"Now what is the kind of person whom a minor offence takes to hell? It
is one who has not cultivated (restraint of) the body, not cultivated
virtue and thought, nor has he developed any wisdom; he is
narrow-minded, of low character and even for trifling things he
suffers. It is such a person whom even a minor offence may take to hell.</p>

<p>

"And what is the kind of person by whom the result of the same small
offence will be experienced in his lifetime, without the least (future
residue)? He is one who has cultivated (restraint of) the body, who has
cultivated virtue and thought, and who has developed wisdom; he is not
limited by (vices), is a great character and he lives unbounded (by
evil).2 It is such a person who experiences the result of the same
small offence during his lifetime, without the least future residue.</p>

<p>

"Now suppose a man throws a lump of salt into a small cup of water.
What do you think, monks: would that small quantity of water in the cup
become salty and undrinkable through that lump of salt?" &mdash;
"It
would, Lord." &mdash; "And why so?" &mdash; "The water in the
cup is so
little that a lump of salt can make it salty and undrinkable."
&mdash;
"But suppose, monks, that lump of salt is thrown into the river Ganges.
Would it make the river Ganges salty and undrinkable?" &mdash;
"Certainly not, Lord." &mdash; "And why not?" &mdash; "Great,
Lord, is
the mass of water in the Ganges. It will not become salty and
undrinkable by a lump of salt."</p>

<p>

"Further, O monks, suppose a person has to go to jail for a matter of a
halfpenny, a penny or a hundred pence, and another man does not have to
go to jail on that account.</p>

<p>

"Now what is the kind of person that has to go to jail for a matter of
a halfpenny, a penny or a hundred pence? It is one who is poor, without
means or property. But he who is rich, a man of means and property,
does not have to go to jail for such a matter."3</p>

<p>

A"nguttara Nikaaya, 3:110</p>

<p>

Hence we may say that it is an individual's accumulation of
good
or evil kamma and also his dominating character traits, good or evil,
which affect the kammic result. They determine the greater or lesser
weight of the result and may even spell the difference between whether
or not it occurs at all.</p>

<p>

But even this does not exhaust the existing possibilities of
modifications in the weight of kammic reaction. A glance into the
life-histories of people we know may well show us a person of good and
blameless character, living in secure circumstances; yet a single
mistake, perhaps even a minor one, suffices to ruin his entire
life&mdash;his reputation, his career, and his
happiness&mdash;and it
may also lead to a serious deterioration of his character. This
seemingly disproportionate crisis might have been due to a
chain-reaction of aggravating circumstances beyond his control, to be
ascribed to a powerful counteractive kamma of his past. But the chain
of bad results may have been precipitated by the person's own
action&mdash;decisively triggered by his initial mistake and
reinforced
by subsequent carelessness, indecision or wrong decisions, which, of
course, are unskilful kamma in themselves. This is a case when even a
predominantly good character cannot prevent the ripening of bad kamma
or soften the full force of the results. The good qualities and deeds
of that person will certainly not remain ineffective; but their future
outcome might well be weakened by any presently arisen negative
character changes or actions, which might form a bad counteractive
kamma.</p>

<p>

Consider too the converse situation: A person deserving to be called a
thoroughly bad character may, on a rare occasion, act on an impulse of
generosity and kindness. This action may turn out to have unexpectedly
wide and favourable repercussions on his life. It might bring about a
decisive improvement in his external circumstances, soften his
character, and even initiate a thorough "change of heart."</p>

<p>

How complex, indeed, are situations in human life, even when they
appear deceptively simple! This is so because the situations and their
outcome mirror the still greater complexity of the mind, their
inexhaustible source. The Buddha himself has said: "The
mind's
complexity surpasses even the countless varieties of the animal
kingdom" (Sa.myutta Nikaaya, 22:100). For any single individual, the
mind is a stream of ever-changing mental processes driven by the
currents and cross-currents of kamma accumulated in countless past
existences. But this complexity, already great, is increased still very
much more by the fact that each individual life-stream is interwoven
with many other individual life-streams through the interaction of
their respective kammas. So intricate is the net of kammic conditioning
that the Buddha declared kamma-result to be one of the four
"unthinkables" (acinteyya) and warned against treating it as a subject
of speculation. But though the detailed workings of kamma escape our
intellection, the practically important message is clear: the fact that
kammic results are modifiable frees us from the bane of determinism and
its ethical corollary, fatalism, and keeps the road to liberation
constantly open before us.</p>

<p>

The potential "openness" of a given situation, however, also has a
negative side, the element of risk and danger: a wrong response to the
situation might open a downward path. It is our own response which
removes the ambiguity of the situation, for better or worse. This
reveals the kamma doctrine of the Buddha as a teaching of moral and
spiritual responsibility for oneself and others. It is truly a "human
teaching" because it corresponds to and reflects man's wide
range
of choices, a range much wider than that of an animal. Any
individual's moral choice may be severely limited by the
varying
load of greed, hatred and delusion and their results which he carries
around; yet every time he stops to make a decision or a choice, he is
potentially free to throw off that load, at least temporarily. At this
precarious and precious moment of choice he has the opportunity to rise
above all the menacing complexities and pressures of his unfathomable
kammic past. Indeed, in one short moment he can transcend aeons of
kammic bondage. It is through right mindfulness that man can firmly
grasp that fleeting moment, and it is mindfulness again that enables
him to use it for making wise choices.</p>

<p class="hd">II</p>

<p>Every
kammic action, as soon as it is performed, first of all affects the
doer of the deed himself. This holds with as much truth for bodily and
verbal deeds directed towards others as it does for volitional thoughts
that do not find outward expression. To some extent we can control our
own response to our actions, but we cannot control the way others
respond to them. Their response may turn out to be quite different from
what we expect or desire. A good deed of ours might be met with
ingratitude, a kind word may find a cold or even hostile reception. But
though these good deeds and kind words will then be lost to the
recipient, to his own disadvantage, they will not be lost to the doer.
The good thoughts that inspired them will ennoble his mind, even more
so if he responds to the negative reception with forgiveness and
forbearance rather than anger and resentment.</p>

<p>

Again, an act or word meant to harm or hurt another may not provoke him
to a hostile reaction but only meet with self-possessed calmness. Then
this "unaccepted present will fall back to the giver," as the Buddha
once told a brahmin who had abused him. The bad deed and words, and the
thoughts motivating them, may fail to harm the other, but they will not
fail to have a damaging effect on the character of the doer; and it
will affect him even worse if he reacts to the unexpected response by
rage or a feeling of resentful frustration. Hence the Buddha says that
beings are the responsible owners of their kamma which is their
inalienable property. They are the only legitimate heirs of their
actions, inheriting their legacy of good or bad fruits.</p>

<p>

It will be a wholesome practice to remind oneself often of the fact
that one's deeds, words and thoughts first of all act upon
and
alter one's own mind. Reflecting thus will give a strong
impetus
to true self-respect, which is preserved by protecting oneself against
everything mean and evil. To do so will also open a new, practical
understanding of a profound saying of the Buddha:</p>

<p>

In this fathom-long body with its perceptions and thoughts there is the
world, the origin of the world, the ending of the world and the path to
the ending of the world.</p>

<p>

A"nguttara Nikaaya, 4:45</p>

<p class="hd">III</p>

<p>The
"world" of which the Buddha speaks is comprised in this aggregate of
body-and-mind. For it is only by the activity of our physical and
mental sense faculties that a world can be experienced and known at
all. The sights, sounds, smells, tastes and bodily impressions which we
perceive, and our various mental functions, conscious and
unconscious&mdash;this is the world in which we live. And this
world of
ours has its origin in that very aggregate of physical and mental
processes that produces the kammic act of craving for the six physical
and mental sense objects.</p>

<p>

"If, Ananda, there were no kamma ripening in the sphere of the senses,
would there appear any sense-sphere existence?" &mdash; "Surely
not,
Lord."</p>

<p>

A"nguttara Nikaaya, 3:76</p>

<p>

Thus kamma is the womb from which we spring (kamma-yoni), the true
creator of the world and of ourselves as the experiencers of the world.
And through our kammic actions in deed, word and thought, we
unceasingly engage in building and re-building this world and worlds
beyond. Even our good actions, as long as they are still under the
influence of craving, conceit and ignorance, contribute to the creation
and preservation of this world of suffering. The Wheel of Life is like
a treadmill set in perpetual motion by kamma, chiefly by its three
unwholesome roots&mdash;greed, hatred and delusion. The "end of the
world" cannot be reached by walking on a treadmill; this only creates
the illusion of progress. It is only by stopping that vain effort that
the end can be reached.</p>

<p>

It is "through the elimination of greed, hatred and delusion that the
concatenation of kamma comes to an end" (A"nguttara Nikaaya, 10:174).
And this again can happen nowhere else than in the same aggregate of
body-and-mind where suffering and its causes originate. It is the
hopeful message of the third noble truth that we can step out of the
weary round of vain effort and misery. If, despite our knowledge of the
possibility of release, we keep walking on the treadmill of life, that
is because of an age-old addiction hard to break, the deeply rooted
habit of clinging to the notions of "I," "mine" and "self." But here
again there is the hopeful message in the fourth noble truth with its
Noble Eightfold Path, the therapy that can cure the addiction and
gradually lead us to the final cessation of suffering. And all that is
required for the therapy is again found in our own body and mind.</p>

<p>

The treatment proper starts with correctly understanding the true
nature of kamma and thereby our situation in the world. This
understanding will provide a strong motivation for ensuring a
prevalence of good kamma in one's life. And as it deepens by
seeing the human condition still more clearly, this same understanding
will become the spur for breaking the chains of kammic bondage. It will
impel one to strive diligently along the path, and to dedicate all
one's actions and their fruits to the greatest end of
action&mdash;the final liberation of oneself and all sentient
beings.</p>

<p>

With the decline of Newtonian physics and the emergence of quantum
theory and relativity, the physical world-picture in the West became
centered around a process-concept. Natural sciences and nineteenth
century scientifically oriented philosophy were in quest of new
criteria that could be better adjusted to their specific aims than the
crude causal interpretation of the whole world, "with its men and gods"
(as the Buddha would say) in bare analogy to "dead matter" in its
macroscopic common-sense aspect. This was the end of the stiff
mechanistic absolutism based on the substance-view, and the
corresponding conception of causality as the universal pattern of blind
determinism in nature. The dominant role of physics was about to be
replaced by a prevalently biological orientation. This at least was the
tendency of the new vitalistic philosophy, whose most preeminent
representative was Henri Bergson.</p>

<p>

By this essential turning, modern philosophy seemed to return to
pathways that closely, though not explicitly, resembled certain
specific features of Buddhism, which have arisen out of different
contexts and much earlier in time. The first to advert to this analogy
explicitly, in the terms of a new philosophy of culture, was Friedrich
Nietzsche. The idea of his "eternal recurrence" of cosmic and
historical cycles, taken over from early Greek philosophy, was not
sufficient for his dynamic "transvaluation of all values." Yet the way
from the early Ionian world-view to the Indian heritage in the
dissolving civilizations of the Near East&mdash;out of which
ultimately
the Ionian Renaissance had arisen&mdash;was not very long. Thus
Nietzsche discovered in the teaching of the Buddha an archetypal model
for his own vitalistic attitude in philosophy. His interpretation of
Buddhism became a paradoxical counterpoint accompanying
Nietzsche's antithetic position to Christianity.</p>

<p>

Despite its rather strange position in the structure of
Nietzsche's own thought, his interpretation of Buddhism is
neither vague nor unauthentic. Nietzsche found his access to Buddhism
through the basic text of The Dhammapadam (probably
Fausboll's
masterly Latin translation of 1855, the first in Europe). In Chapter I,
5, the Buddha is quoted as saying: "Enmities are never appeased by
enmity, but they are appeased by non-enmity. This is the eternal law."
In Nietzsche's interpretation, this statement is "the moving
refrain of the whole of Buddhism ... and quite rightly: it is precisely
these emotions &lsquo;of resentment' which would be
thoroughly
unhealthy with regard to the main dietetic objective," since Buddhism
"no longer speaks of &lsquo;struggle against sin' but,
quite in
accordance with actuality, &lsquo;the struggle against
suffering.'" Suffering is in Nietzsche's
existential
interpretation "a state of depression arisen on the basis of
physiological conditions: against this depression Buddha takes hygienic
measures." The Buddha was a "deep physiologist, whose
&lsquo;religion' should more properly be called a
&lsquo;hygiene' ... whose effect depends on the victory
over
resentment: to make the soul free from it&mdash;this is the first
step
towards health. &lsquo;Enmity is not ended by enmity'
&hellip;
this is not a moral advice, this is an advice of physiology."</p>

<p>

As brutally partial as this interpretation may seem even to Buddhists,
it nevertheless singled out an essential point whose deeper
implications will remain characteristic for the development of the
later philosophical thought on the main subject of the present paper.</p>

<p>

On the other hand, at the end of the nineteenth century, and also much
later, missionaries of more popular versions of Buddhism, still unaware
of the essential purport of the new scientific and philosophical
world-view emerging in their own cultural ambience, were praising
Buddhism for its eminently rational advantages as a religion founded on
the "solid scientific basis" of the universally valid "principle of
causality," almost in its Newtonian meaning. For at that time the term
pa.ticca-samuppaado, or "interdependent origination" of all phenomena
(dhammaa), used to be interpreted in analogy to the "hard facts" of
physics and physically oriented "positive" sciences. This understanding
of the principle of causality seemed sufficient to account for the
generally Indian teaching on karma, the basic principle of moral
determinism, and for its peculiarly Buddhist version, distinguished by
the Buddha's negation of a permanent soul-principle (anattaa)
in
the process of becoming, visualized as a "stream" (sa.msaara) of
life-experience, and corresponding most closely, as we shall see, to
Bergson's flux du vecu.</p>

<p>

It seems that at that time, and for a long time after, nobody except
Nietzsche was interested in taking note of another humble historical
fact, namely, that the Buddha's attitude to the world as a
whole
was emphatically negative: sabba-loke anabhirati, disgust with the
whole world&mdash;not only because the world, whose overlord is
Death
(Maaro), is essentially anguish or suffering (dukkham), but also
because the deeper reason for this existential anguish is the "nullity"
(su~n~nam) of our-self-being-in-the-world, or "nihilation" as we might
express it in twentieth century terms:</p>

<p>

"Since in this very life such a being (as the Buddha) cannot be
identified by you as existing in truth, in reality, is it proper for
you to state that such a being is the superman, the most excellent man
who has attained the highest aim, and that such a being, if he has to
be designated, should be designated in other than these four terms:
&lsquo;Such a being exists after death'; or &lsquo;he
does not
exist after death'; or &lsquo;he both does and does not
exist
after death'; or &lsquo;he neither does nor does not
exist after
death'?"</p>

<p>

"Surely not, reverend sir."</p>

<p>

"Good, Anuraadho. Both formerly and now, it is just suffering that I
proclaim, and the ceasing of suffering."</p>

<p class="hd">II</p>

<p>In
the
oldest Buddhist texts of Abhidhamma ("about phenomena"), the central
conception of phenomenological analysis (vibhajjavaado) was
concentrated on the idea of a "stream of existence" (bhava"nga-soto),
or, in a free translation, emergence of fluctuating articulation. Thus,
in early Buddhism as in modern philosophy, "substance-thought" had to
be replaced by "process-thought." Long before the Buddha,
substance-thought was formulated in the Vedantic conception, contained,
among so many other world-views, in the earliest Upanishads as the
teaching of an absolute, all-encompassing being, Brahman, conceived as
"changeless, all-pervading, unmoving, immovable, eternal." In negating
all these attributes, the Buddha challenged Vedantic absolutism by
adopting the alternative solution of resolving all "being" into flux
and nullity (su~n~nataa), in negating even a permanent or static
soul-principle (anattaa, or the negation of aatmaa, the Vedantic Self).</p>

<p>

Thus the core of the Abhidhamma conception of the "stream of existence"
consists in its theory of momentariness (kha.nikavaado). Its modern
analogy has found its first and best formulation in the philosophy of
William James, especially in his essay, Does "Consciousness"Exist?,
where the "stream of consciousness" or "stream of thinking" (which,
"when scrutinized, reveals itself to consist chiefly of the stream of
my breathing") is elicited from his basic theory of "pure experience,"
defined as "the instant field of the present ... this succession of an
emptiness and fullness that have reference to each other and are of one
flesh"&mdash; succession "in small enough pulses," which "is the
essence of the phenomenon." In the same connection, as "the result of
our criticism of the absolute," the metaphysical and metapsychical idea
of a "central self" is reduced by James to "the conscious self of the
moment."</p>

<p>

Compare this with Whitehead's further elaboration in his
metaphysical conception of "actual occasions" and "throbbing
actualities" understood as "pulsations of experience," whose "drops" or
"puffs of existence" guided by an internal teleology of their
"concrescence" (analogous to the Buddhist sa"nkhaaraa in kammic
formation) join the "stream of existence."</p>

<p>

All this was summarized by Bergson in a statement which to a Buddhist
sounds like a formulation in the simplest and most authentic terms
common to all schools and periods of Buddhist thought: "There are
changes, but there are underneath the change no things which change:
change has no need of a support ... movement does not imply a mobile."</p>

<p>

In his introduction to the French translation of Pragmatism by William
James, Bergson says that "from the point of view taken by James, which
is that of pure experience or of &lsquo;radical
empiricism,'
reality ... flows without our being able to say whether it is in a
single direction, or even whether it is always and throughout the same
river flowing."&nbsp; And in his own Introduction to Metaphysics,
he
says, "All reality is, therefore, tendency, if we agree to call
tendency a nascent change of direction."</p>

<p>

Bergson's approach to a biologically oriented philosophy of
life
was entirely different from Nietzsche's intentions. He did
not
explicitly consider the cultural implications of the biological
reorientation of the new philosophy of nature until the last period of
his activity (The Two Sources of Morality and Religion, 1932).
Bergson's most important work, Creative Evolution, which
appeared
in 1907, begins with the question, "What is the precise meaning of the
word &lsquo;exist'?" The answer, at the end of the first
section,
is:</p>

<p>

We are seeking only the precise meaning that our consciousness gives to
this word "exist," and we find that, for a conscious being, to exist is
to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating
oneself endlessly.</p>

<p>

In such maturing and "creation of self by self, which is the more
complete, the more one reasons on what one does,"9 consists the problem
of freedom. In this process, each individual self-consciousness "lives
and develops itself as an effect of its own hesitations until a free
action is detached from it as if it were an overripe fruit."</p>

<p>

The Buddha also speaks of the guidance, or protective care, "of self by
self" in the same process of "the ripening fruit of action," thus: "One
oneself is the guardian of oneself. What other guardian would there
be?" (Dhammapadam, 160).</p>

<p>

"If, Aananda, there were no kamma (karma), action ripening in the
sphere of sense existence, would there appear any sensual becoming?"
&mdash; "Surely not, Lord."</p>

<p>

"And wherever the action ripens, there the individual experiences the
fruit of that action, be it in this life, or in the next life, or in
future lives."</p>

<p>

"The results of kamma are unthinkable, not to be pondered upon."</p>

<p>

Here is Bergson's explanation of the thesis:</p>

<p>

What are we, in fact, what is our character, if not the condensation of
the history that we have lived from our birth- day, even before our
birth, since we bring with us prenatal dispositions? Doubtless we think
with only a small part of our past, but it is with our entire past,
including the original bent of our soul, that we desire, will and act.
Our past, then, as a whole, is made manifest to us in its impulse ...
From this survival of the past it follows that consciousness cannot go
through the same state twice. Our personality, which is being built up
each instant with its accumulated experience, changes without
ceasing.... This is why our duration is irreversible.&hellip; Thus
our
personality shoots, grows and ripens without ceasing.</p>

<p>

Bergson's conception of causality and motivation departs from
the
classical theories of determinism and freedom of action, and approaches
the Indian (not exclusively Buddhist) idea of karma in two essential
points: its psychological origin and its creative character. It is
based on Bergson's critique of both mechanistic and
finalistic
theories in biology:</p>

<p>

Evolution will thus prove to be something entirely different from a
series of adaptations to circumstances, as mechanism claims; entirely
different also from the realization of a plan of the whole, as
maintained by the doctrine of finality.... Such a philosophy of life
... claims to transcend both mechanism and finalism, but ... it is
nearer the second doctrine than the first.</p>

<p>

As for this second doctrine, Bergson maintains that "the finalistic
interpretation, such as we shall propose it, could never be taken for
an anticipation of the future.... How could we know beforehand a
situation that is unique of its kind, that has never yet occurred and
will never occur again? Of the future, only that is foreseen which is
like the past or can be made up again with elements like those of the
past. Such is the case with astronomical, physical and chemical facts,
with all facts which form part of a system in which elements supposed
to be unchanging are merely put together, in which the only changes are
changes of position.... But an original situation, which imparts
something of its own originality to its elements ...; how can such a
situation be pictured as given before it is actually produced? All that
can be said is that, once produced, it will be explained by the
elements that analysis will then carve out of it. Now, what is true of
the production of a new species is also true of the production of a new
individual and more generally, of any moment of any living form."</p>

<p>

Compare the simpler statement of the Buddha, with strict reference to
the karmic, i.e. the morally relevant, act:</p>

<p>

If anyone were to say &lsquo;this person commits an act and he will
suffer accordingly'&mdash;if that were the case, there
would be
no (use of leading a) life of holiness, and there would be no
opportunity of putting an end to suffering. If anyone were to say
&lsquo;this person commits an act for which he deserves to suffer
accordingly'&mdash;if that were the case, there would be
(a use
of leading) a life of holiness, and there would be an opportunity of
putting an end to suffering.</p>

<p>

The vitalist attempt to re-examine the problems of causality, finality
and freedom of will, from Bergson's standpoint of
"transformalism" brought us to a wider epistemological problem of
establishing adequate relations between science, history and
philosophy&mdash;a problem extensively discussed by the later
philosophies of existence:</p>

<p>

Science can work only on what is supposed to repeat itself.... Anything
that is irreducible and irreversible in the successive moments of a
history eludes science. To get a notion of this irreducibility and
irreversibility, we must break with scientific habits which are adapted
to the fundamental requirements of thought, we must do violence to the
mind, go counter to the natural bent of the intellect. But this is just
the function of philosophy. Modern science is the daughter of
astronomy; it has come down from heaven to earth along the inclined
plane of Galileo, for it is through Galileo that Newton and his
successors are connected with Kepler.&hellip; Each material point
became a rudimentary planet.&hellip; Modern science must be defined
pre-eminently by its aspiration to take time as an independent variable.</p>

<p>

But to the artist who creates a picture by drawing it from the depths
of his soul, time is no longer an accessory.&hellip; The duration
of
his work is part and parcel of his work. To contract or to dilate it
would be to modify both the psychical evolution that fills it and the
invention which is its goal. The time taken up by the invention is one
with the invention itself. It is the progress of a thought which is
changing in the degree and measure that it is taking form. It is a
vital process, something like the ripening of an idea.</p>

<p>

Compare with this the statement of Buddhaghosa, in Atthasaalini: "By
time the Sage described the mind, and by mind described the time."</p>

<p>

The "scission" of intellect from intuition is explained by Bergson (and
later existentialists) by the "practical nature of perception and its
prolongation in intellect and science"; we could almost say, by the
lack of contemplative interest in modern, technically oriented science.
Thus, in a deduction which reminds us of Heidegger's basic
thesis
on the scope of metaphysics, Bergson formulates the question:</p>

<p>

But has metaphysics understood its role when it has simply trodden in
the steps of physics, in the chimerical hope of going further in the
same direction? Should not its own task be, on the contrary, to remount
the incline that physics descends, to bring back matter to its origins,
and to build up progressively a cosmology, which would be, so to speak,
a reversed psychology?</p>

<p>

Everything is obscure in the idea of creation, if we think of things
which are created and of a thing which creates, as we habitually do, as
the understanding cannot help doing.... It is natural to our intellect,
whose function is essentially practical, made to present to us things
and states rather than changes and acts. But things-and-states are only
views, taken by our mind, of becoming. There are no things, there are
only actions.</p>

<p>

Epoch&eacute;, refraining from judgments based on such "views"
(Greek
doxa, Sanskrit drish.ti, Pali di.t.thi), the philosophical method
brought from India by Pyrrho of Elis at the time of Alexander the
Great, has become in the twentieth century the fundamental method of
Husserl's "meditating philosopher" in phenomenological
analysis.
It is a "science of phenomena, which lies far removed from our ordinary
thinking, and has not until our own day therefore shown an impulse to
develop &hellip; so extraordinarily difficult ... a new way of
looking
at things, one that contrasts at every point with the natural attitude
of experience and thought," whose development is felt, however, as an
"urgent need nowadays."</p>

<p>

The teaching of the Buddha was, with a still wider purpose, the
expression of "the right effort" (sammaa-vaayaamo) to "swim against the
stream" of such world-views, i.e. "the type of views called the thicket
of views, the wilderness of views, the contortion of views, the
vacillation of views, the fetter of views."</p>

<p>

In Bergson's theory of intuition, the act of "swimming
against
the stream" is interpreted with his basic French term torsion:</p>

<p>

Let us try to see, no longer with the eyes of the intellect alone,
which grasps only the already made and which looks from the outside,
but with the spirit, I mean with that faculty of seeing which is
immanent in the faculty of acting and which springs up, somehow, by the
twisting of the will on itself, when action is turned into knowledge,
like heat, so to say, into light.</p>

<p>

By intuition I mean instinct that has become disinterested,
self-conscious, capable of reflecting upon its object and of enlarging
it indefinitely. That an effort of this kind is not impossible is
proved by the existence in man of an aesthetic faculty along with the
normal perception.&hellip; This intention is just what the artist
tries
to regain, in placing himself back within the object by a kind of
sympathy, in breaking down, by an effort of intuition, the barrier that
space puts up between him and his model.</p>

<p>

The ultimate metaphysical consequences implied in a theory of causation
based on the biological phenomenon of the "ripening fruit" were taken
into adequate consideration only in some later philosophies of
existence. Yet the preparatory vitalistic stage of modern philosophy
remains more important for an Indian reinterpretation of the theory of
karma than can be assessed within strictly European limits, where the
importance of the missing link between the vitalist and existentialist
stages&mdash;the link of a new theory of causality&mdash;has
not yet
been fully and explicitly realized. Let us therefore conclude the
survey of this cycle of ideas by returning to the lowest level on which
Bergson's vitalistic interpretation of cosmic matter had to
establish a new starting point:</p>

<p>

Let us merely recall that extension admits of degrees, that all
sensation is extensive in a certain measure, and that the idea of
unextended sensations, artificially localized in space, is a mere view
of the mind, suggested by an unconscious metaphysic much more than by
psychological observation. No doubt we make only the first steps in the
direction of the extended, even when we let ourselves go as much as we
can. But suppose for a moment that matter consists in this very
movement pushed further, and that physics is simply psychics inverted.</p>

<p>

The conception of "a cosmology which would be a reversed psychology,"
or of physics understood "simply as psychics inverted," was destined to
become the fulcrum for a transition from a physical to an historical
orientation in other contemporary philosophies. This transition is also
clearly marked in Whitehead's later works: "Physical
endurance is
the process of continuously inheriting a certain identity of character
transmitted through a historic route of events."</p>

<p>

Bergson expressed this emphasis in terms which brought him still closer
to a specific aspect of later existentialist thought: the predominant
importance of the future for (karmic) shaping of the present by the
past. Though Heidegger's critique of Bergson's idea
of the
"stream of experience" was concentrated on this point, where in an
initial metaphor Bergson compares a "mental state, as it advances on
the road of time, continually swelling with the duration which it
accumulates" with "a snowball on the snow, rolling upon itself" and
thus increasing&mdash;we can read a few pages later in the opening
chapter of Creative Evolution another statement, anticipating
Heidegger's objection to some extent: "Duration is the
continuous
progress of the past which gnaws into the future and which swells as it
advances."</p>

<p class="hd">III</p>

<p>Martin
Heidegger, in his basic work, Being and Time,31 seems to take over the
meditation on "the ripening fruit" at the critical point reached by
Bergson's analysis of its wider biological scope: the karmic
predicament of human existence. It can be seen from
Heidegger's
numerous critical references to Bergson (though in many cases I would
not agree with them) that in the meantime it had become obvious that
there was more to elicit by the process philosophy than the
biologically oriented thinkers of the vitalist period could realize.
The philosophy of existence undertook this work in essentially
different dimensions. Heidegger in particular was very careful and
explicit in critically adapting new methods of independent historical
thinking in the philosophy of culture introduced by Dilthey, and above
all the new structure of transcendental logic laid down by his teacher
Husserl, for phenomenological analysis independent of natural science.
Within the scope of this new framework, similarities with Buddhist
thought emerge still more strikingly, especially in the domain of the
"suffering/concern" theme and the need for the notion of karma in a
process-multiple causality structure.</p>

<p>

The second part of Being and Time deals in particular with problems of
human reality and temporality (Dasein und Zeitlichkeit). The
possibility for human being to attain to full ripeness in an existence
conditioned by man's "being-towards-death" is discussed in
the
first chapter ("Dasein's authentic
potentiality&mdash;for-being-a-whole and its being-towards-death").
Chapter Five is dedicated to "temporality and historicality" as
essential constituents of the human being32 involved in this ambiguous
process.</p>

<p>

When, for instance, a fruit is unripe, it "goes toward" its ripeness.
In this process of ripening, that which the fruit is not yet is by no
means pieced on as something not yet present-at-hand. The fruit brings
itself to ripeness, and such a bringing of itself is a characteristic
of its being as a fruit. Nothing imaginable which one might contribute
to it would eliminate the unripeness of the fruit, if this entity did
not come to ripeness of its own accord. When we speak of the "not-yet"
of the unripeness, we do not have in view something else which stands
outside, and which&mdash;with utter indifference to the
fruit&mdash;might be present-at-hand in it and with it. What we
have in
view is the fruit itself in its specific kind of being.&hellip; The
ripening fruit, however, not only is not indifferent to its unripeness
as something other than itself, but it is that unripeness as it ripens.
The "not-yet" has already been included in the very being of the fruit,
not as some random characteristic, but as something constitutive.
Correspondingly, as long as any Dasein is, it too is already its
"not-yet."33</p>

<p>

The implicit emphasis laid on the difference from the "classical"
European mechanist theory of causality is obvious enough.</p>

<p>

The karmic process, in its Buddhist meaning, can be defined as a
vicious circle of "interdependent origination" (pa.ticca-samuppaado),
consisting of a chain of twelve rings (nidaanam), the first of which is
avijjaa, "ignorance," or better, metaphysical nescience of a human
being (defined by Heidegger as a "being-there"&mdash;Dasein) about
his
own emergence in the flux of existence. The last ring of the chain is
"death." Heidegger's analysis of human reality as a "being
there"
in the world is not less distinctly determined and delimited by the
tension of the same polarity&mdash;ignorance and death:</p>

<p>

If the term "understanding" is taken in a way which is primordially
existential, it means to be projecting towards a
potentiality-for-being, for the sake of which any Dasein exists. In
understanding, one's own potentiality-for-being is disclosed
in
such a way that one's Dasein always knows understandingly
what it
is capable of. It "knows" this, however, not by having discovered some
fact, but by maintaining itself in an existential possibility. The kind
of ignorance which corresponds to this, does not consist in an absence
or cessation of understanding, but must be regarded as a deficient mode
of the projectedness of one's potentiality-for-being.
Existence
can be questionable.... When one understands oneself protectively in an
existential possibility, the future underlies this understanding, and
it does so as a coming-towards-oneself out of that current possibility
as which one's Dasein exists. Projection is basically
futural.&hellip; Temporality does not temporalize itself constantly
out
of the authentic future. This inconstancy, however, does not mean that
temporality sometimes lacks a future, but rather that the temporalizing
of the future takes various forms.</p>

<p>

This seems to explain one step further the "hesitation" of the self
"until a free action is detached as an overripe fruit," as Bergson
expressed the limits of freedom as release (moksha) within the scope of
a karmic determinism.</p>

<p>

With ripeness, the fruit fulfills itself. But is the death at which
Dasein arrives, a fulfilment in this sense? With its death, Dasein has
indeed "fulfilled its course." But in doing so, has it necessarily
exhausted its specific possibilities? For the most part, Dasein ends in
unfulfilment, or else by having disintegrated and been used up. Ending
does not necessarily mean fulfilling oneself. It thus becomes more
urgent to ask in what sense, if any, death must be conceived as the
ending of Dasein.</p>

<p>

Arising out of this situation, the problem of karma, implicitly felt as
an "anticipatory resoluteness" in "concrete working out of temporality"
aiming at an "authentic historizing of Dasein," is further discussed as
the existential problem of "Dasein's
potentiality-for-being-a-whole."</p>

<p>

Since "those possibilities of existence which have been factically
disclosed are not to be gathered from death ... we must ask whence, in
general, Dasein can draw those possibilities upon which it factically
projects itself." The answer is:</p>

<p>

The resoluteness in which Dasein comes back to itself, discloses
current factical possibilities of authentic existing, and discloses
them in terms of the heritage which that resoluteness, as thrown, takes
over. In one's coming back resolutely to one's
thrownness,
there is hidden a handing down to oneself of the possibilities that
have come down to one, but not necessarily as having thus come down.</p>

<p>

We shall take for granted that the coincidence of the expression
(underlined by me) "thus come down" with the literal meaning of the
most common attribute of the Buddha&mdash;tathaagato&mdash;is
another
of many casual cases where a modern philosophy of essentially the same
trend as our archaic one will, to some extent, come to use the same
terms in expressing ideas of the same kind. What is meant here by the
same trend will be explicated later. Let us first single out the
specific meaning of this important term in the specific context.</p>

<p>

The word tathaagato, in its widest sense in the early Pali literature,
is used as a designation of "human being" in general. Its logical
connection with the Buddha's best known definition of the
human
being as "heir of his own actions" is obvious, even when it is used as
the highest epithet of the Buddha.</p>

<p>

What Heidegger wishes to point out is that the "heritage" of a
tathaagato has not to be understood here as a passive facticity of
historically "objectified" social tradition or collective behavior,
which in Heidegger's terms would be designated as
"inauthentic
heritage." Unlike the social study of external history, Dasein in its
intimate ripening "never comes back behind its thrownness" in the
"situationality" of its world. In other words, in a personal history
there is no possibility of statically objective repetition of one and
the same situation. This is the basic law of karmic development that
both Bergson and Heidegger try to confirm on different levels of their
investigations.</p>

<p>

On this point, in Heidegger's philosophy, "thrownness"
appears as
a critical term whose meaning has to be better determined, in view of
the fact that it denotes an obvious Christian "cypher" for a karmically
determined situation. This historical implication in basic
existentialist terminology could even be interpreted by some critics as
revealing an apparent deficiency of our analogy, had not Heidegger,
fortunately for us, explained it, in the same context, by an
"attribute" synonymous with the basic First Truth of the Buddha,
dukkha, "anguish" or "worry": "Before we decide too quickly whether
Dasein draws its authentic possibilities of existence from thrownness
or not, we must assure ourselves that we have a full conception of
thrownness as a basic attribute of care."</p>

The translation of the German word Sorge by "care" may often diminish
the full meaning of "Dasein's character" of this fundamental
"existentiale" or practical category on which Heidegger's
entire
ontology is built. From our standpoint, "worry" would often seem a
preferable translation. Yet Heidegger himself has left no doubt about
the meaning of this term. At the end of the first part of Being and
Time, whose aim it was to "exhibit Care (Sorge) as the Being of
Dasein," i.e. "of that entity which in each case we ourselves are, and
which we call &lsquo;man,'" the basic "ontical" meaning
of Sorge
is interpreted (and illustrated by an ancient fable) as "worry" and
"grief."</p>

<p>

The continuation of the inquiry shows how the karmic phenomenon has to
be comprised within the scope of this central theme&mdash;how the
essence of worry and grief is revealed in response to the "call of
conscience." First of all Heidegger's philosophy is no longer
a
philosophy of consciousness, but a philosophy of conscience. (The word
"consciousness" is never used by Heidegger except in critical disputes,
mainly with the Kantians.) Here conscience discloses itself as the
awakening call which alone can liberate us from our lost condition
(Verlorenheit) and thrownness in avijjaa (ignorance), or metaphysical
"nescience." Only in giving heed to the awakening call does "Dasein
understand itself with regard to its potentiality-for-being" in
man's mindfulness and resoluteness "to take over in his
thrownness&mdash;right under the eyes of Death&mdash;that
entity which
Dasein is itself, and to take it over wholly," as his karmic load. In
Heidegger's words, "Resoluteness is defined as a projecting
of
oneself upon one's own Being-guilty&mdash;a projecting
which is
reticent and ready for anxiety."39 This is the ultimate moral aspect of
the "hesitation in the ripening fruit" of the Bergsonian "creative
activity."</p>

<p>

The last metaphysical (or better, eschatological) question to which
Heidegger's inquiry into the phenomenon of karma, or
"ripening
fruit," arrives, concerns the origin of that strange experience, the
primeval phenomenon of all religion: being-guilty.</p>

<p>

"The call of conscience" is the call of care. Being guilty constitutes
the being to which we give the name of "care." In uncanniness Dasein
stands together with itself primordially. Uncanniness brings this
entity face to face with its undisguised nullity, which belongs to the
possibility of its own-most potentiality-for-being. &hellip; The
appeal
calls back by calling forth: it calls Dasein forth to the possibility
of taking over, in existing, even that thrown entity which it is.</p>

<p>

The statement underlined by me ("Der Anruf ist vorrufender Rueckruf")
is the best short definition of karma that I can imagine, even if it
had to be formulated by the greatest master of Zen art in Japan (an art
not at all unknown to Heidegger). The next one is not less pregnant
with deep oriental meaning:</p>

<p>

We have seen that care is the basic state of Dasein. The ontological
signification of the expression "care" has been expressed in the
definition: ahead-of-itself-being-already-in "the world" as
being-alongside entities which we encounter "within-the-world."</p>

<p>

Heidegger insists on an implicit consciousness of karma in the
experience of care, or worry, as Dasein's "understanding of
itself in being-guilty." He equally insists on the fact that even
"phenomena with which the vulgar interpretation has any familiarity
point back to the primordial meaning of the call of conscience when
they are understood in a way that is ontologically appropriate," and
that "this interpretation, in spite of all its obviousness, is by no
means accidental."</p>

<p>

And yet, the call of conscience is "a keeping silent. Only in keeping
silent does the conscience call; that is to say, the call comes from
the soundlessness of uncanniness, and the Dasein which it summons is
called back into the stillness of itself, and called back as something
that is to become still." A Japanese student in Heidegger's
seminar once interpreted this course of thoughts in terms of a few Zen
koans. A follower of Ramana Maharshi in India could do it just as well
to Heidegger's full satisfaction.</p>

<p>

Having, unfortunately, no better word than "destiny" wherewith to
designate the full range of the category of karma (though fully
conscious of the wide horizon it encompasses), Heidegger brings us
ultimately to the following summary of essential questions on this
subject:</p>

<p>

But it remains all the more enigmatic in what way this event as destiny
is to constitute the whole "connectedness" of Dasein from its birth to
its death. How can recourse to resoluteness bring us an enlightenment?
ls not each resolution just one more single "experience" in the
sequence of the whole connectedness of our experience?&hellip; Why
is
it that the question of how the "connectedness of life" is constituted
finds no adequate and satisfactory answer? Is our investigation
overhasty? Does it not, in the end, hang too much on the answer,
without first having tested the legitimacy of the question?48</p>

<p>

Speaking of the problem of re-emergence or "recurrence" of existential
situations in their essential dependence on "destiny" in
Dasein's
"historizing" course, Heidegger does not even indirectly attempt to
formulate any hypothesis analogous to "rebirth" (as, e.g., Nietzsche
did in his own way) in Indian religious thought (punarbhava), though
his sensitivity for the "enigmatic" remainder of the problem, as traced
above, permits a still closer approach to this complex issue: "Dasein
can be reached by the blows of destiny only because in the depth of its
own being Dasein is destiny ... a possibility which it has inherited
and yet has chosen."</p>

<p>

In suggesting the categorial designation of "karma" for the whole range
of problems concerning the organic connectedness of vital processes
whose ripening results in creative activity, my intention remains far
from any attempt to propose any overhasty solution or pattern that
could be discovered readymade in the transcendental schematism of some
specific type of Asian philosophy or religion, such as Buddhism.
Though, for the purpose of the present survey, Buddhism was chosen as
the tertium comparationis, it was presumed as a well-known fact that
the historical origin of the categorial designation of karma in Indian
philosophy is considerably older than its specific interpretation by
the Buddha.</p>
