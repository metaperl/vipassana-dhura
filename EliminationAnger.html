<p class="hd">The Elimination of Anger</p>

<p>The
ultimate goal of Buddhism is the deathless condition of Nibbaana, the sole
reality. Hence, one who aspires to that state should renounce mundane pursuits
and attachments, which are ephemeral, for the sake of that reality. But there
are very few who are sufficiently mature to develop themselves to achieve that
state in this very life. Thus the Buddha does not force the life of
renunciation upon those who lack the spiritual capacity to embark upon the
higher life.</p>
<p>Therefore,
one should follow the path of mundane advantage which is twofold, namely, the
advantage obtainable here in this very life and the advantage obtainable in
future lives, as steps on the path of the spiritual life. Although one may
enjoy the pleasures of life, one must regard one's body as an instrument with
which to practice virtue for one's own and other's benefit; in short, one
should live a useful life of moral integrity, a life of simplicity and paucity
of wants. As regards acquisition of wealth, the Buddha said: "One must be
diligent and energetic," and as regards the safeguarding of one's wealth, "one
must be mindful and economical."</p>
<p>It
is not impossible that even the life of such a man may be somehow or other
disturbed and harassed as a result of the actions of "unskilful" men. Although
this might induce him to abandon his chosen path, it is at such times that one
must not forget the steps to be taken for the purpose of establishing peace.
According to the teaching of the Buddha this includes the reflection: "Others
may be harmful, but I shall be harmless, thus should I train myself." We must
not forget that the whole spirit of Buddhism is one of pacification. In the
calm and placid atmosphere of the Buddha's teaching there is every chance,
every possibility, of removing hatred, jealousy and violence from our mind.</p>
<p>It
is no wonder if we, at times, in our everyday life, feel angry with somebody
about something. But we should not allow this feeling to reside in our mind. We
should try to curb it at the very moment it has arisen. Generally there are
eight ways to curb or control our anger.</p>
<p>The
first method is to recollect the teachings of the Buddha. On very many
occasions the Buddha explained the disadvantages of an angry temper. Here is
one of his admonitions:</p>

<p>Suppose some bandits catch one of you and
sever his body limb from limb with a two-handed saw, and if he should feel
angry thereby even at that moment, he is no follower of my teaching.</p>

<p>&mdash; Kakacuupama Sutta, Majjhima Nikaaya 21</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<p>As a log from a pyre, burnt at both ends
and fouled in the middle, serves neither for firewood in the village nor for
timber in the forest, so is such a wrathful man.</p>

<p>&mdash; A.nguttara Nikaaya II 95</p>

<p>Further,
we may consider the Buddha's advice to be found in the Dhammapada:</p>

<p>He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me,
he robbed me of my property. Whosoever harbour such thoughts will never be able
to still their enmity.</p>

<p>Never indeed is hatred stilled by hatred;
it will only be stilled by non-hatred &mdash; this is an eternal law.</p>

<p>
&mdash; Dhp 4-5</p>

<p>Do not speak harshly to anyone. Those who
are harshly spoken to might retaliate against you. Angry words hurt other's
feelings; even blows may overtake you in return.</p>

<p>
&mdash; Dhp 133</p>


<p>Forbearance is the highest observance.
Patience is the highest virtue. So the Buddhas say.</p>

<p>
&mdash; Dhp 184</p>


<p>Let a man remove his anger. Let him root
out his pride. Let him overcome all fetters of passions. No sufferings overtake
him who neither clings to mind-and-body nor claims anything of the world.</p>

<p>
&mdash; Dhp 221</p>


<p>Conquer anger by non-anger. Conquer evil by
good. Conquer miserliness by liberality. Conquer a liar by truthfulness.</p>

<p>
&mdash; Dhp 223</p>


<p>Guard your mind against an outburst of
wrong feelings. Keep your mind controlled. Renouncing evil thoughts, develop
purity of mind.</p>

<p>
&mdash; Dhp 233</p>


<p>If
by contemplating the advice of the Buddha in this way one cannot curb his
anger, then let him try this second method.</p>
<p>Naturally,
any bad person may possess some good quality. Some men are evil in mind but
speak in deceptive language or slyly perform their deeds in an unsuspecting
manner. Some men are coarse only in their language but not in their mind or
deeds. Some men are coarse and cruel in their deeds but neither in their speech
nor in their mind. Some are soft and kind in mind, speech and deed as well.</p>
<p>When
we feel angry with any person, we should try to find some good in him, either
in his way of thinking, or in his way of speaking or in his way of acting. If
we find some redeeming quality in him, we should ponder its value and ignore
his bad qualities as natural weaknesses that are to be found in everyone.
Whilst we think thus, our mind will soften and we may even feel kindly towards
that person. If we develop this way of thinking we will be able to curb or
eliminate our anger towards him.</p>
<p>At
times, this method may not be successful and we shall then have to try the
third method. Basically, this entails reflecting thus:</p>
<p>"He
has done some wrong to me and in so doing has spoiled his mind. Then why should
I spoil or impair my own mind because of his foolishness? Sometimes I ignore
support or help offered by my relatives; sometimes they even shed tears because
of my activities. Being a person of such type myself, why should I not
therefore ignore that foolish man's deed? </p>
<p>"He
has done that wrong, being subject to anger, should I too follow him, making my
mind subject to anger? Is it not foolish to imitate him? He harbouring his
hatred destroys himself internally. Why should I, on his account, destroy my
reputation?</p>
<p>"All
things are momentary. Both his mind and body are momentary too. The thoughts
and the body with which the wrong was done to me are not now existing. What I
call the same man is now different thoughts and physical parts from the earlier
ones that harmed me although belonging to the same psycho-physical process.
Thus, one thought together with one mass of physical parts did me some wrong,
and vanished there and then, giving place to succeeding thoughts and material
parts. So with which am I getting angry? With the vanished and disappeared
thoughts and physical parts or with the thoughts and material parts which do
not do any wrong now? Should I get angry with one thing which is innocent,
whereas another thing has done me wrong and vanished?</p>
<p>"The
so-called 'I' is not the same for two consecutive moments. At the moment the
wrong was done there was another thought and another mass of molecules which
were regarded as 'I,' whereas what are regarded as 'I' at the present moment
are a different thought and collection of molecules, though belonging to the
same process. Thus some other being did wrong to someone else and another gets
angry with another. Is this not a ridiculous situation?"</p>
<p>If
we scrutinize the exact nature of our life and its happenings in this manner,
our anger can subside or vanish there and then.</p>
<p>There
is another way, too, to eliminate upsurging anger. Suppose we think of someone
who has done wrong to us. On such occasions we should remember that we suffer
harm or loss as a result of our previous <i>kamma.</i> Even if others were
angry with us, they could not harm us if there were no latent force of past
unwholesome <i>kamma</i> committed by us which took advantage of this
opportunity to arouse our adversary. So it is I who am responsible for this harm
or loss and not anybody else. And at the same time, now while I am suffering
the result of past <i>kamma,</i> if I, on account of this, should get angry and
do any harm to him, by that do I accumulate much more unwholesome <i>kamma</i>
which would bring me correspondingly unwholesome results.</p>
<p>If
we recall to mind this law of <i>kamma,</i> our anger may subside immediately.
We can consider such a situation in another way too. We as the followers of
Buddha believe that our Bodhisatta passed through incalculable numbers of lives
practicing virtues before he attained Buddhahood. The Buddha related the
history of some of his past lives as illustrations to teach us how he practiced
these virtues. The lives of the prince Dhammapala and the ascetic Khantivaadii
are most illustrative and draw our attention.</p>

<p>At one time the Bodhisatta had been born as the son of
a certain king named Mahaapatapa. The child was named Culla Dhammapaala. One
day the Queen sat on a chair fondling her child and did not notice the King
passing by. The King thought the Queen was so proud of her child as not to get
up from her chair even when she saw that her lord the King passed that way. So
he grew angry and immediately sent for the executioner. When he came the King
ordered him to snatch the child from the Queen's arms and cut his hands, feet
and head off, which he did instantly. The child, our Bodhisatta, suffered all
that with extreme patience and did not grow ill-tempered or relinquish his
impartial love for his cruel father, lamenting mother and the executioner. So
far had he matured in the practice of forbearance and loving-kindness at that
time.</p>

<p>At another time, our Bodhisatta was an
ascetic well-known for his developed virtue of forbearance and consequently
people named him Khantivaadi, the preacher of forbearance. One day he visited
Benares and took his lodgings at the royal pleasure grove. Meanwhile, the King
passed that way with his harem and, seeing the ascetic seated under a tree,
asked what virtue he was practicing, to which the ascetic replied that of
forbearance. The King was a materialist who regarded the practice of virtue to
be humbug. So, hearing the words of the ascetic, he sent for the executioner
and ordered him to cut off his hands and feet and questioned the ascetic as to
whether he could hold to forbearance at the severing of his limbs. The ascetic
did not feel ill-tempered and even at that time he lay down extending his
loving-kindness and holding his forbearance undiminished. He spoke to the King
in reply to the effect that his forbearance and other virtues were not in his
limbs but in his mind. The King, being unsuccessful in his attempts to disturb
the ascetic's feelings, grew angrier and kicked the stomach of the ascetic with
his heel and went away. Meanwhile, the King's minister came over and, seeing
what had happened, bowed before the dying ascetic and begged him saying:
"Venerable one, none of us agreed to this cruel act of the King and we are all
sorrowing over what has been done to you by that devilish man. We ask you to
curse the King but not us." At this the ascetic said: "May that king who has
caused my hands and feet to be cut off, as well as you, live long in happiness.
Persons who practice virtues like me never get angry." Saying this, he breathed
his last.</p>
<p>Since
the Buddha in his past lives, while still imperfect like us, practiced
forbearance and loving-kindness to such a high extent, why cannot we follow his
example?</p>
<p>When
we remember and think of similar noble characters of great souls, we should be
able to bear any harm, unmoved by anger. Or if we consider the nature of the
round of rebirths in this beginningless and infinite universe, we will be able
to curb our upspringing anger. For it is said by the Buddha: "It is not easy to
find a being who has not been your mother, your father, your brother, sister,
son or daughter." Hence with regard to the person whom we have now taken for
our enemy, we should think: "This one now, in the past has been my mother who
bore me in her womb for nine months, gave birth to me, unweariedly cleansed me
of impurities, hid me in her bosom, carried me on her hip and nourished me.
This one was my father in another life and spent time and energy, engaged in
toilsome business, with a view to maintaining me, even sacrificing life for my
sake," and so on. When we ponder over these facts, it should be expected that
our arisen anger against our enemy will subside.</p>
<p>And
further, we should reflect on the advantages of the development of mind through
the practice of extending loving-kindness. For the Buddha has expounded to us
eleven advantages to be looked for from its development. What are the eleven?
The person who fully develops loving-kindness sleeps happily. He wakes happily.
He experiences no evil dreams. He is beloved of men. He is beloved even of non-human
beings. He is protected by the gods. He can be harmed neither by fire, poison
or a weapon. His mind is quickly composed. His complexion is serene. At the
moment of his death he passes away unbewildered. If he can go no further along
the path of realization, he will at least be reborn in the heavenly abode of
the Brahma Devas.</p>
<p>So,
by every similar and possible way should we endeavour to quench our anger and
at last be able to extend our loving-kindness towards any and every being in
the world.</p>
<p>When
we are able to curb our anger and control our mind, we should extend from
ourselves boundless love as far as we can imagine throughout every direction,
pervading and touching all living beings with loving-kindness. We should
practice this meditation every day at regular times without any break. As a
result of this practice, we will be able, one day, to attain to the <i>jhaanas</i>
or meditative absorptions, comprising four grades, which entail the control of
sensuality, ill-will and many other passions, bringing at the same time purity,
serenity and peace of mind.</p>

<p class="hd">Two Stories Retold from the Buddhist Texts</p>

<p class="subhd">1. The Reviler</p>
<p>Once
while the Blessed One stayed near Raajagaha in the Ve.nuvana Monastery at the
Squirrels' Feeding Place, there lived atspan style="color: windowtext;" lang="EN-GB">
Raajagaha a Brahman of the Bhaaradvaaja clan who was later called "the
Reviler." When he learned that one of his clan had gone forth from home life
and had become a monk under the recluse Gotama, he was angry and displeased.
And in that mood he went to see the Blessed One, and having arrived he reviled
and abused him in rude and harsh speech.</p>
<p>Thus
being spoken to, the Blessed One said: "How is it, Brahman: do you sometimes
receive visits from friends, relatives or other guests?"</p>
<p>"Yes,
Master Gotama, I sometimes have visitors."</p>
<p>"When
they come, do you offer to them various kinds of foods and a place for
resting?"</p>
<p>"Yes,
I sometimes do so."</p>
<p>"But
if, Brahman, your visitors do not accept what you offer, to whom does it then
belong?"</p>
<p>"Well,
Master Gotama, if they do not accept it, these things remain with us."</p>
<p>"It
is just so in this case, Brahman: you revile us who do not revile in return,
you scold us who do not scold in return, you abuse us who do not abuse in
return. So we do not accept it from you and hence it remains with you, it
belongs to you, Brahman..."</p>
<p>The
Buddha finally said:</p>

<p>Whence should wrath
rise for him who void of wrath,<br>

Holds on the even tenor of his way,<br>

Self-tamed, serene, by highest insight free?</p>

<p>"Worse of the two is he
who, when reviled,<br>

Reviles again. Who doth not when reviled,<br>

Revile again, a two-fold victory wins.<br>

Both of the other and himself he seeks<br>

The good; for he the other's angry mood<br>

Doth understand and groweth calm and still.<br>

He who of both is a physician, since<br>

Himself he healeth and the other too &mdash;<br>

Folk deem him a fool, they knowing not the Norm.<a href="#Link1">1</a></p>

<p>&mdash;<em>Abridged and
freely rendered from Sa.myutta Nikaaya, Braahma.na Sa.myutta, No. 2. Verses

<p class="subhd">Note</p>

<a name="Link1"></a>

<p>1. The "Norm" or law
(Dhamma) here referred to may be expressed in the words of the Dhammapada (v.
5):</p>


<p>"Not by hating, hatred ceases<br>

In this world of tooth and claw;<br>

Love alone from hate releases &mdash;<br>

This is the Eternal Law."</p>

<p><em>[Translated by Francis Story]</em></p>


<p class="subhd">2. The Anger-eating Demon</p>

<p>Retold from an ancient
Buddhist Story<br />
by Nyanaponika Thera</p>

<p>Once
there lived a demon who had a peculiar diet &mdash; he fed on the anger of others.
And as his feeding ground was the human world, there was no lack of food for
him. He found it quite easy to provoke a family quarrel, or national and racial
hatred. Even to stir up a war was not very difficult for him. And whenever he
succeeded in causing a war, he could properly gorge himself without much
further effort; because once a war starts, hate multiplies by its own momentum
and affects even normally friendly people. So the demon's food supply became so
rich that he sometimes had to restrain himself from over-eating, being content
with nibbling just a small piece of resentment found close-by.</p>
<p>But
as it often happens with successful people, he became rather overbearing and
one day when feeling bored he thought: "Shouldn't I try it with the gods?" On
reflection he chose the Heaven of the Thirty-three Deities, ruled by Sakka,
Lord of Gods. He knew that only a few of these gods had entirely eliminated the
fetters of ill-will and aversion, though they were far above petty and selfish
quarrels. So by magic power he transferred himself to that heavenly realm and
was lucky enough to come at a time when Sakka the Divine King was absent. There
was none in the large audience hall and without much ado the demon seated
himself on Sakka's empty throne, waiting quietly for things to happen, which he
hoped would bring him a good feed. Soon some of the gods came to the hall and
first they could hardly believe their own divine eyes when they saw that ugly
demon sitting on the throne, squat and grinning. Having recovered from their
shock, they started to shout and lament: "Oh you ugly demon, how can you dare
to sit on the throne of our Lord? What utter cheekiness! What a crime! You
should be thrown headlong into the hell and straight into a boiling cauldron!
You should be quartered alive! Begone! Begone!"</p>
<p>But
while the gods were growing more and more angry, the demon was quite pleased
because from moment to moment he grew in size, in strength and in power. The
anger he absorbed into his system started to ooze from his body as a smoky
red-glowing mist. This evil aura kept the gods at a distance and their radiance
was dimmed.</p>
<p>Suddenly
a bright glow appeared at the other end of the hall and it grew into a dazzling
light from which Sakka emerged, the King of Gods. He who had firmly entered the undeflectible Stream that leads Nibbaana-wards, was unshaken by what he
saw. The smoke-screen created by the gods' anger parted when he slowly and
politely approached the usurper of his throne. "Welcome, friend! Please remain
seated. I can take another chair. May I offer you the drink of hospitality? Our
Amrita is not bad this year. Or do you prefer a stronger brew, the vedic Soma?"</p>
<p>While
Sakka spoke these friendly words, the demon rapidly shrank to a diminutive size
and finally disappeared, trailing behind a whiff of malodorous smoke which
likewise soon dissolved.</p>

<p><i>&mdash; Based on Sa.myutta Nikaaya, Sakka Sa.myutta, No. 22</i></p>


<p>The
gist of this story dates back to the discourses of the Buddha. But even now,
over 2500 years later, our world looks as if large hordes of Anger-eating
Demons are haunting it and are kept well nourished by millions slaving for them
all over the earth. Fires of hate and wide-travelling waves of
violence threaten to engulf mankind. Also the grass roots of society are
poisoned by conflict and discord, manifesting in angry thoughts and words and
in violent deeds. Is it not time to end this self-destructive slavery of man to
his impulses of hate and aggression which only serve the demoniac forces? Our
story tells how these demons of hate can be exorcised by the power of
gentleness and love. If this power of love can be tested and proven, at
grass-root level, in the widely spread net of personal relationships, society
at large, the world at large, will not remain unaffected by it.</p>
