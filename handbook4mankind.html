<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Foreword</a></p>

<p>In 1956, the Venerable Buddhadasa Bhikkhu gave a series of
lectures to a group of prospective judges, which were subsequently
edited and arranged into what became The Handbook for Mankind.</p>
<p>Since then, the success of this small book has been
astounding. Well over 100,000 copies have been printed in Thai, and the
book still enjoys widespread popularity, more than three decades after
the original talks. The reason for the "Handbook's" duration is clear:
that the Venerable Buddhadasa offers fresh insights into a timeless
Truth (Dhamma), in the direct and simple manner that characterizes all
his teaching. The clarity of his insight brings the Dhamma to life, so
that today, a new generation of readers, not yet born at the time of
these talks, can find meaning in his words.</p>
<p>As a guide for newcomers to the Buddha-Dhamma (the Truth which
the Buddha awakened to and subsequently taught), this book is an
invaluable guide. In it are contained the essential teachings of
Buddhism. The "Handbook" is especially useful for those who approach
the Buddha's teaching, not as a subject for scholarly study, buy as a
means to understand and ennoble their lives.</p>
<p>The Handbook for Mankind was originally published in English
by the Sublime Life Mission, buy has long been out of print. With their
permission, we have reprinted this book, making some corrections where
necessary, buy leaving the text otherwise intact. Our thanks are due to
Mr. Pun Chongprasoed, who first put this book together in Thai, and to
all the people whose effort has made possible the reprinting of this
book.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Biography</a></p>

<p>Buddhadasa Bhikkhu (Servant of the Buddha) went forth as a
bhikkhu (Buddhist monk) in 1926, at the age of twenty. After a few
years of study in Bangkok, which convinced him "purity is not to be
found in the big city," he was inspired to live close with nature in
order to investigate the Buddha-Dhamma. Thus, he established Suan
Mokkhabalarama (The Grove of the Power of Liberation) in 1932, near his
hometown of Pum Riang (now in Chaiya District). At that time, it was
the only forest Dhamma Center and one of the few places dedicated to
vipassana meditation in Southern Thailand. Word of Buddhadasa Bhikkhu,
his work, and Suan Mokkh spread over the years so that they are easily
described as "one of the most influential events of Buddhist history in
Siam." Here, we can only mention some of the most interesting services
he has rendered Buddhism.</p>
<p>Ajahn Buddhadasa worked painstakingly to establish and explain
the correct and essential principles of what he called "pristine
Buddhism," that is, the original realization of the Lord Buddha before
it was buried under commentaries, ritualism, clerical politics, and the
like. His work was based in extensive research of the Pali texts (Canon
and commentary), especially of the Buddha's Discourses (Sutta Pitaka),
followed by personal experiment and practice with these teachings. Then
he taught whatever he could say truly quenches dukkha (dissatisfaction,
suffering). His goal was to produce a complete set of references for
present and future research and practice. His approach was always
scientific, straight-forward, and practical.</p>
<p>Although his formal education only went as far as ninth grade
and beginning Pali studies, he was given five Honorary Doctorates by
Thai universities. His books, both written and transcribed from talks,
fill a room at the National Library and influence all serious Thai
Buddhists in Siam. Doctoral dissertations are still being written about
him and his legacy. His books can be found in bookstores around the
country and are favorites as gifts at cremations.</p>
<p>Progressive elements in Thai society, especially the young,
were inspired by his teaching and selfless example. Since the 1960's,
activists and thinkers in areas such as education, ecology, social
welfare, and rural development have drawn upon his teaching and advice.
Most of the monks involved in nature conservation and community
development were inspired by him. He provided the link between the
scriptural tradition and engaged buddhist practice today.</p>
<p>After the founding of Suan Mokkh, he studied all schools of
Buddhism, as well as the other major religious traditions. This
interest was practical rather than scholarly. He sought to unite all
genuinely religious people in order to work together to help, as he put
it, "drag humanity out from under the power of materialism." This
broadmindedness won him friends and students from around the world,
including Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs.</p>
<p>His last project was to establish an International Dhamma
Hermitage. This addition to Suan Mokkh is intended to provide
facilities for:</p>
<p>Courses which introduce foreigners to the correct understanding of Buddhist principles and practice; </p>
<p>Meetings among Buddhists from around the world to establish and agree upon the "heart of Buddhism"; </p>
<p>Meetings of leaders from all religions for the sake of making
mutual good understanding and cooperating to drag the world out from
under the tyranny of materialism.</p>
<p>He also left instructions for a small monastery in which
foreign monks may train as Dhamma-duta (Dhamma missionaries). It now
functions under the name "Daun Kiam" or Suan Atammayatarama.</p>
<p>A similar facility for nuns, Thai and foreign, awaits the
women who will make it happen. He called it Dhamma-Mata (Dhamma
Mothers, those who give birth to others through Dhamma).</p>
<p>Ajarn Buddhadasa died in 1993 after a series of heart attacks and strokes that he kept bouncing back from in order to teach.</p>
<p>The final stroke occured as he was preparing notes for a talk
to be given on his birthday in two days (27 May). Suan Mokkh carries on
in the hearts and actions of all those who have been inspired and
guided by his example and words. Suan Mokkh is not so much a physical
place as it is the space of liberation that we all must discover in
this very life.</p>

<p>Rod Bucknell first became seriously interested in Buddhism in
the mid -1960's, when, during a visit to Thailand, he was introduced to
the techniques of insight meditation. After spending a year in various
Thai meditation centers and monasteries, he took ordination as a
bhikkhu (monk) under the guidance of Ajahn Pannananda of Wat
Cholapratan Rangsarit. He soon became interested also in the teachings
of Ajahn Buddhadasa, and, recognizing their potential value to
westerners, began translating some of the Ajahn's more important works
into English. During the four years he spent in the Sangha, he
translated altogether six works of varying length, usually in close
consultation with the Ajahn in order to ensure accuracy in the
rendering of key concepts. Despite his return to lay life, he maintains
a close interest - both scholarly and practical - in Ajahn Buddhadasa's
teachings, and has published several related articles in religious
studies journals. He is currently a lecturer in the Department of
Studies in Religion at the University of Queensland, Australia.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Chapter 1: &nbsp;Looking At Buddhism</a></p>

<p>If we open any recent book on the origins of religion, we find
that there is one point on which all authors are in agreement. They all
agree in saying that religion arose in the world out of fear. Primitive
forest-dwelling man feared thunder and lightning, darkness and storms,
and various things about him that he was unable to understand or
control. His method of avoiding the danger he saw in these phenomena
was to demonstrate either humility and submission or homage and
reverence, depending on which he felt was most appropriate. Later, as
man's knowledge and understanding developed, this fear of the forces of
nature changed into a fear of phenomena more difficult to apprehend.
Religions based on deference to objects of fear such as natural
phenomena, spirits and celestial beings, came to be looked down upon as
unreasonable and ridiculous. And then man's fear became still more
refined into a fear of suffering, suffering of the sort that cannot be
alleviated by any material means. He came to fear the suffering
inherent in birth, ageing, pain and death, the disappointment and
hopelessness which arise out of desire, anger and stupidity, which no
amount of power or wealth can relieve. Long ago in India, a country
well provided with thinkers and investigators, intelligent people
dispensed with all paying of homage to supernatural beings and started
seeking instead the means of conquering birth, ageing, pain and death,
the means of eliminating greed, hatred and delusion. Out of this search
arose Buddhism, a higher religion based on insight, a means of
conquering birth, ageing, pain and death, a method for destroying the
mental defilements. Buddhism has its origins in fear of this last kind,
just as do all religions based on intelligence The Buddha discovered
how to conquer absolutely what man fears: he discovered a practical
method, now called Buddhism for eliminating suffering.</p>
<p>"Buddhism" means "the Teaching of the Enlightened One." A
Buddha is an enlightened individual, one who knows the truth about all
things, one who knows just what is what, and so is capable of behaving
appropriately with respect to all things. Buddhism is a religion based
on intelligence, science and knowledge, whose purpose is the
destruction of suffering and the source of suffering. All paying of
homage to sacred objects by means of performing rites and rituals,
making offerings or praying is not Buddhism. The Buddha rejected all
this as foolish, ridiculous and unsound. He also rejected the celestial
beings, then considered by certain groups to be the creator of things,
and the deities supposed to dwell, one in each star in the sky. Thus we
find that the Buddha made such statements as these:</p>
<p>"Knowledge, skill and ability are conducive to success and
benefit and are auspicious omens, good in their own right regardless of
the movements of the heavenly bodies. With the benefits gained from
these qualities, one will completely outstrip those foolish people who
just sit making their astrological calculations." And: "If the water in
rivers (such as the Ganges) could really wash away sins and suffering,
then the turtles, crabs, fish and shellfish living in those sacred
rivers ought by now to be freed of their sins and sufferings too." And:
"If a man could eliminate suffering by making offerings, paying homage
and praying, there would be no one subject to suffering left in the
world, because anyone at all can pay homage and pray. But since people
are still subject to suffering while in the very act of making
obeisances, paying homage and performing rites, this is clearly not the
way to gain liberation."</p>
<p>To attain liberation, we first have to examine things closely
in order to come to know and understand their true nature. Then we have
to behave in a way appropriate to that true nature. This is the
Buddhist teaching; this we must know and bear in mind. Buddhism has
nothing to do with prostrating oneself and deferring to awesome things.
It sets no store by rites and ceremonies such as making libations of
holy water, or any externals whatsoever, spirits and celestial being
included. On the contrary, it depends on reason and insight. Buddhism
does not demand conjecture or supposition; it demands that we act in
accordance with what our own insight reveals and not take anyone else's
word for anything. If someone comes and tells us something, we must not
believe him without question. We must listen to his statement and
examine it. Then if we find it reasonable, we may accept it
provisionally and set about trying to verify it for ourselves. This is
a key feature of Buddhism, which distinguishes it sharply from other
world religions.</p>
<p>Now a religion is a many-sided thing. Seen from one angle it
has a certain appearance; seen from another angle, it has another. Many
people look at religion from the wrong angle, and Buddhism is no
exception. Different individuals looking at Buddhism with different
mental attitudes are bound to get different views of it. Because each
of us naturally has confidence in his own opinions, the truth for each
of us coincides with our own particular understanding and point of
view. Consequently, "the Truth" is not quite the same thing for
different people. They all penetrate questions to varying depth by
varying methods, and with varying degrees of intelligence A person does
not recognize as true, according to his own ideas of the Truth,
anything that lies beyond his own intelligence, knowledge and
understanding. And even though he may outwardly go along with other
people's ideas as to what is the truth, he knows in himself that it is
not the truth as he himself sees it. Each person's conception of the
truth may change and develop with the day by day increase in his degree
of intelligence, knowledge and understanding, until such time as he
arrives at the ultimate truth; and each of us has different ways of
examining and testing before believing. So if Buddhism is viewed with
differing degrees of intelligence, differing pictures of it will be
seen, simply because it can be viewed from an aspect. As we have said,
Buddhism is a practical method for liberating oneself from suffering by
means of coming to realize as did the Buddha himself, the true nature
of things. Now any religious text is bound to contain material which
later people have found occasion to add to, and our Tipitaka is no
exception. People in later ages have added sections based on then
current ideas, either in order to boost people's confidence or out of
excessive religious zeal. Regrettably even the rites and rituals which
have developed and become mixed in with the religion are now accepted
and recognized as Buddhism proper. Ceremonies, such as setting up trays
of sweets and fruit as offerings to the "soul" of the Buddha in the
same way as alms food is offered to a monk just do not fit in with
Buddhist principles. Yet some groups consider this to be genuine
Buddhist practice, teaching it as such and keeping to it very strictly.</p>
<p>Rites and ceremonies of this kind have become so numerous that
they now completely obscure the real Buddhism and its original purpose.
Take for example the procedure of becoming ordained a monk. There has
come into existence the ceremony of making gifts to the newly ordained
bhikkhu Guests are invited to bring food and to watch proceedings, and
as a result, there is much drunkenness and noise. Ceremonies are
performed both at the temple and in the home. The new bhikkhu later
leaves the Order again only a few days after having been ordained, and
may become an even stronger temple-hater than he was before. It must be
borne in mind that there was none of this at the time of the Buddha. It
is a later development. Ordination at the time of the Buddha meant
simply, that some individual, who had obtained his parent's consent,
renounced home and family. He was a person who was able to close
accounts at home and go off to join the Buddha and the Order of
bhikkhus. On some convenient occasion he would go and be ordained, and
perhaps not see his parents or family again for the rest of his life.
Though some bhikkhus might go back to visit their parents again on
suitable occasions, this was rare. There does exist a rule permitting a
bhikkhu to go home when there is a good reason for doing so, but at the
time of the Buddha this was not the done thing. Bhikkhus did not
receive ordination with their parents in attendance nor did they
celebrate the event as a great occasion, only to leave the Sangha again
after just a few days, no better off than at first, as commonly happens
in the present day.</p>
<p>All this presenting of gifts to newly ordained bhikkhus, this
performing of ceremonies, including all sorts of celebration - this we
are foolish enough to call Buddhism! Furthermore we choose to make much
of it, thinking nothing of spending all our own money, or other
people's on account of it. This "Neo-Buddhism" is so widespread as to
be almost universal. The Dhamma, the genuine teaching that once was
paramount has become so overlaid by ceremonial that the whole objective
of Buddhism has been obscured, falsified and changed. Ordination, for
instance, has become a face-saving gambit for young men whom people
have been pointing at for never having been ordained, or a prerequisite
to finding a wife (as having been a monk is considered a sign of
maturity), or is done with some other kind of ulterior motive. In some
places an ordination is regarded as an opportunity for collecting money
for which job there are always people on hand to help. It is one way of
getting rich. Even this they call Buddhism! And anyone who goes and
criticizes this is considered to be ignorant of Buddhism or opposed to
it.</p>
<p>Another example is the presentation of kathina cloth The
Buddha's original intention was to have cloth for robes given to all
the bhikkhus simultaneously so that they could sew it together
themselves with a minimum loss of time. If there was only one robe, it
was allocated to some bhikkhu not necessarily the most senior one, whom
the group considered worthy of using that role or in need of it, and
was presented to him in the name of the entire order. The Buddha's
intention was to avoid any bhikkhu's having a high opinion of himself.
On that day everyone, regardless of rank, had to humble himself and be
one of the crowd. Everyone had to lend a hand cutting and sewing the
cloth, boiling tree pith to make the dye, and whatever else was
involved in getting the robes ready and finished the same day. Making
the cloth into robes was a co-operative effort. That is how the Buddha
intended it to be, an event not necessarily involving lay people at
all. But nowadays it has become an affair involving ceremony, fun and
games, loud laughter and money seeking. It is just a picnic and is
devoid of all the desirable results originally intended.</p>
<p>This sort of thing is a tumour which has developed in Buddhism
and thrived. The tumour takes hundreds of different forms too numerous
to name. It is a dangerous, malignant growth which by degrees has
completely overlaid and obscured the good material, the real pith of
Buddhism, and quite disfigured it. One result of this has been the
arising of many sects, some large, some insignificant, as off-shoots
from the original religion. Some sects have even become involved in
sensuality. It is essential that we always discriminate in order to
recognize what is the real, original Buddhism. We must not foolishly
grasp at the outer shell, or become so attached to the various rituals
and ceremonies that the real objective becomes quite lost to view. The
real practice of Buddhism is based on purification of conduct by way of
body and speech, followed by purification of the mind, which in its
turn leads to insight and right understanding. Don't go thinking that
such and such is Buddhism just because everyone says it is. The tumour
has been spreading constantly since the day the Buddha died, expanding
in all directions right up to the present day, so that it is now quite
sizeable. The tumour in Buddhism must not be misidentified as Buddhism
itself. It is also wrong for of other religions to come and point at
these shameful disgraceful growths as being Buddhism. It is unjust,
because these things are not Buddhism at all; they are excrescence.
Those of us interested in furthering Buddhism, whether as a foothold
for all people, or for our own private well-being, must know how to get
hold of the true essence of Buddhism and not just grab at some
worthless outgrowth. Now even the genuine Buddhism is many-sided, a
fact which may lead to a false grasp of true meaning. For instance, if
looked at from the point of view of a moral philosopher, Buddhism is
seen to be a religion of morality. There is talk of merit and demerit,
good and evil, honesty, gratitude, harmony, open-heartedness and much
more besides. The Tipitaka is full of moral teachings. Many newcomers
to Buddhism approach it from this angle and are attracted to it on this
account.</p>
<p>A more profound aspect is Buddhism as Truth, as the deep
hidden truth lying below the surface and invisible to the ordinary man.
To see this truth is to know intellectual emptiness of all things; the
transience, unsatisfactoriness and non-selfhood of all things; to know
intellectually the nature of suffering, of the complete elimination of
suffering and of the way to attain the complete elimination of
suffering; to perceive these in terms of absolute truth, the kind that
changes and which everyone ought to know. This is Buddhism as Truth.</p>
<p>Buddhism as Religion is Buddhism as a system of practice based
on morality, concentration and insight, and culminating in liberating
insight; a system which when practised to completion enables one to
break free from suffering. This is Buddhism as Religion.</p>
<p>Then there is Buddhism as Psychology, as it is presented to us
in the third section of the Tipitaka, where the nature of the mind is
described in remarkable detail. Buddhist psychology is a source of
interest and astonishment to students of the mind even in the present
day. It is far more detailed and profound than present day
psychological knowledge.</p>
<p>Another aspect is Buddhism as Philosophy. Philosophical
knowledge can be clearly seen by means of reasoned logical proofs but
cannot be demonstrated experimentally. It contrasts with science, which
is knowledge resulting from seeing something clearly, with our eyes, or
through physical experimentation and proof, or even with the "inner
eye" of intuition. Profound knowledge such as that of emptiness is just
philosophy for a person who has not yet penetrated to the truth, and
science for another who has done so, such as a fully enlightened
individual, or arahant, who has seen it clearly, intuitively. Many
aspects of Buddhism, in particular the Four Noble Truths, are
scientific in so far as they can be verified by clear experimental
proof using introspection. For anyone equipped with awareness and
interested in studying and carrying out research, the cause - effect
relationships are there just as in science. Buddhism is not just
something obscure and vague, not just philosophy, as are man-made
subjects.</p>
<p>Some look on Buddhism as Culture. Anyone with a high regard
for culture finds many aspects of Buddhist practice which are common to
all cultures and also many that are characteristically Buddhist and far
better and higher than anything in other cultures.</p>
<p>Of all these various aspects, the one a real Buddhist ought to
take most interest in is Buddhism as Religion. We ought to look on
Buddhism as a direct practical method for gaining knowledge of the true
nature of things, knowledge which makes it possible to give up every
form of grasping and clinging, of stupidity and infatuation, and become
completely independent of things. To do this is to penetrate to the
essence of Buddhism. Buddhism considered in this aspect is far more
useful than Buddhism considered as mere morality, or as truth which is
simply profound knowledge and not really practical; and more useful
than Buddhism considered as philosophy, as something to be enjoyed as
an object of speculation and argument of no value in the giving up of
the mental defilements; and certainly more useful than Buddhism
considered simply as culture, as attractive behaviour, noteworthy from
the sociological viewpoint.</p>
<p>At the very least, everyone ought to consider Buddhism as Art,
as the Art of Living - in other words, as skill and competence in being
a human being, living in a way that is exemplary and praiseworthy,
which so impresses others that they automatically wish to emulate it.
What we have to do is to cultivate the "Three Lustres," firstly
developing moral purity, training the mind to be tranquil and steady
and fit to its job, and finally developing such an abundance of wisdom
and clear insight into the nature of all things that those things are
no longer able to give rise to suffering. When anyone's life has these
Three Lustres, he can be considered to have mastered the art of living.
Westerners are extremely interested in Buddhism as the Art of Living,
and discuss this aspect more than any other. Penetrating so far into
the real essence of Buddhism that we are able to take it as our guide
to living induces spiritual good cheer and joy, dispersing depression
and disillusionment. It also dispels fears, such as the fear that the
complete giving up of spiritual defilements would make life dry and
dreary and utterly devoid of flavour, or the fear that complete freedom
from craving would make all thought and action impossible, whereas in
reality a person who organizes his life in accordance with the Buddhist
Art of Living is victor over all the things about him. Regardless of
whether these things be animals, people, possessions, or anything else,
and regardless of whether they enter that person's consciousness by way
of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind, they will enter as
losers, unable to becloud, defile, or perturb him. The winning of
victory over all things is genuine bliss.</p>
<p>Buddha-Dhamma will enrapture a mind that has developed a taste
for it. It can be considered an indispensable form of nourishment too.
True, a person still controlled by the defilements continues to desire
nourishment by way of the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body and goes in
search of it as suits his nature. But there is another part of him,
something deeper, that does not demand that sort of nourishment. It is
the free or pure element in his mind. It wishes the joy and delight of
spiritual nourishment, starting with the delight that results from
moral purity. It is the source of contentment for fully enlightened
individuals, who possess such tranquillity of mind that defilements
cannot disturb them, who possess clear insight into the true nature of
all things and have no ambitions with regard to any of them. They are,
so to speak, able to sit down without being obliged to run hither and
yon like those people to whom the Buddha applied the simile "smoke by
night, fire by day."</p>
<p>"Smoke by night" refers to sleeplessness, restlessness. A
sufferer from this complaint lies all night with hand on brow, planning
on going after this and that, working out how to get money, how to get
rich quickly and get the various things he desires. His mind is full of
"smoke." All he can do is lie there until morning, when he can get up
and go running off in obedience to the wishes of the "smoke" he has
been holding back all night. This fervent activity is what the Buddha
referred to as "fire by day." These are the symptoms of a mind that has
not achieved tranquillity, a mind that has been deprived of spiritual
nourishment. It is a pathological hunger and thirst induced by the
defilement called craving. All night long the victim represses the
smoke and heat, which in the morning becomes fire, and then blazes hot
inside him all day. If a person is obliged, throughout his entire life,
to suppress the "smoke by night," which then becomes "fire by day," how
can he ever find peace and coolness? Just visualize his condition. He
endures suffering and torment all his life, from birth up until he
enters the coffin, simply for lack of the insight that could completely
extinguish that fire and smoke. To treat such a complaint one has to
make use of the knowledge provided by the Buddha. The smoke and fire
diminish in proportion to one's degree of understanding of the true
nature of things.</p>
<p>As we have said, Buddhism has a number of different aspects or
sides. Just as the same mountain when viewed from a different direction
presents a different appearance, so different benefits are derived from
Buddhism according to how one looks at it. Even Buddhism has its
origins in fear--not the foolish fear of an ignorant person who kneels
and makes obeisance to idols or strange phenomena, but a higher kind of
fear, the fear of perhaps never attaining liberation from the
oppression of birth, ageing, pain and death, from the various forms of
suffering we experience. The real Buddhism is not books, not manuals,
not word for word repetition from the Tipitaka, nor is it rites and
rituals. These are not the real Buddhism. The real Buddhism is the
practice, by way of body, speech and mind that will destroy the
defilements, in part or completely. One need not have anything to do
with books or manuals. One ought not to rely on rites and rituals, or
anything else external, including spirits and celestial beings. Rather
one must be directly concerned with bodily action, speech and thought.
That is, one must persevere in one's efforts to control and eliminate
the defilements so that clear insight can arise. One will then be
automatically capable of acting appropriately, and will be free of
suffering from that moment right up to the end.</p>
<p>This is the real Buddhism. This is what we have to understand.
Let us not go foolishly grasping at the tumour that is obscuring
Buddhism, taking it for the real thing.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Chapter 2: &nbsp;The True Nature Of Things</a></p>

<p>The word "religion" has a broader meaning than the word
"morality." Morality has to do with behavior and happiness, and is
basically the same the world over. A religion is a system of practice
of a high order. The ways of practice advocated by the various
religions differ greatly. Morality made us good people, behaving in
accordance with the general principles of community life and in such a
way as to cause no distress to ourselves or others. But though a person
may be thoroughly moral, he may still be far from free of the suffering
attendant on birth, ageing, pain and death, still not free from
oppression by the mental defilements. Morality stops well short of the
elimination of craving, aversion and delusion, so cannot do away with
suffering. Religion, particularly Buddhism, goes much further than
this. It aims directly at the complete elimination of the defilements,
that is, it aims at extinguishing the various kinds of suffering
attendant on birth, ageing, pain and death. This indicates how religion
differs from mere morality, and how much further Buddhism goes than the
moral systems of the world in general. Having understood this, we can
now turn our attention to Buddhism itself.</p>
<p>Buddhism is a system designed to bring a technical knowledge
inseparable from its technique of practice, an organized practical
understanding of the true nature of things or what is what. If you keep
this definition in mind, you should have no difficulty understanding
Buddhism. Examine yourself and see whether or not you know what is
what. Even if you know what you are yourself, what life is, what work,
duty, livelihood, money, possessions, honour and fame are, would you
dare to claim that you know everything? If we really knew what is what,
we would never act inappropriately; and if we always acted
appropriately, it is a certainty that we would never be subject to
suffering. As it is, we are ignorant of the true nature of things, so
we behave more or less inappropriately, and suffering results
accordingly. Buddhist practice is designed to teach us how things
really are. To know this in all clarity is to attain the Fruit of the
Path, perhaps even the final Fruit, Nirvana, because this very
knowledge is what destroys the defilements. When we come to know what
is what, or the true nature of things, disenchantment with things takes
the place of fascination, and deliverance from suffering comes about
automatically. At the moment, we are practising at a stage where we
still do not know what things are really like, in particular, at the
stage of not yet realizing that all things are impermanent and not
selves. We don't as yet realize that life, all the things that we
become infatuated with, like, desire and rejoice over, is impermanent,
unsatisfactory and not self. It is for this reason that we become
infatuated with those things, liking them, desiring them, rejoicing
over them, grasping at them and clinging to them. When, by following
the Buddhist method, we come to know things aright, to see clearly that
they are all impermanent, unsatisfactory and not selves, that there is
really nothing about things that might make it worth attaching our
selves to them, then there will immediately come about a slipping free
from the controlling power of those things. Essentially the Buddha's
teaching as we have it in the Tipitaka is nothing but the knowledge of
what is what or the true nature of things--just that. Do keep to this
definition. It is an adequate one and it is well to bear it in mind
while one is in the course of practising We shall now demonstrate the
validity of this definition by considering as an example the Four Noble
Truths. The First Noble Truth, which points out that all things are
suffering, tells us precisely what things are like. But we fail to
realize that all things are a source of suffering and so we desire
those things. If we recognized them as a source of suffering, not worth
desiring, not worth grasping at and clinging to, not worth attaching
ourselves to, we would be sure not to desire them. The Second Noble
Truth points out that desire is the cause of suffering. People still
don't know, don't see, don't understand, that desires are the cause of
suffering. They all desire this, that and the other, simply because
they don't understand the nature of desire. The Third Noble Truth
points out that deliverance, freedom from suffering, Nirvana, consists
in the complete extinguishing of desire. People don't realize at all
that nirvana is something that may be attained at any time or place,
that it can be arrived at just as soon as desire has been completely
extinguished. So, not knowing the facts of life, people are not
interested in extinguishing desire. They are not interested in nirvana
because they don't know what it is. The Fourth Noble Truth is called
the Path and constitutes the method for extinguishing desire. No one
understands it as a method for extinguishing desire. No one is
interested in the desire extinguishing Noble Eightfold Path. People
don't recognize it as their very point of support, their foothold,
something which they ought to be most actively reinforcing. They are
not interested in the Buddha's Noble Path, which happens to be the most
excellent and precious things in the entire mass of human knowledge, in
this world or any other. This is a most horrifying piece of ignorance.
We can see, then, that the Four Noble Truths are information telling us
clearly just what is what. We are told that if we play with desire, it
will give rise to suffering, and yet we insist on playing with it until
we are brim full of suffering. This is foolishness. Not really knowing
what is what or the true nature of things, we act in every way
inappropriately. Our actions are appropriate all too rarely. They are
usually "appropriate" only in terms of the values of people subject to
craving, who would say that if one gets what one wants, the action must
have been justified. But spiritually speaking, that action is
unjustifiable. Now we shall have a look at a stanza from the texts
which sums up the essence of Buddhism, namely the words spoken by the
bhikkhu Assaji when he met Sariputta before the latter's ordination.
Sariputta asked to be told the essence of Buddhism in as few words as
possible. Assaji answered: "All phenomena that arise do so as a result
of causes. The Perfected One has shown what the causes are, and also
how all phenomena may be brought to an end by eliminating those causes.
This is what the Great Master teaches." He said in effect: Every thing
has causes that combine to produce it. It cannot be eliminated unless
those causes have been eliminated first. This is a word of guidance
warning us not to regard anything as a permanent self. There is nothing
permanent. There are only effects arising out of causes, developing by
virtue of causes, and due to cease with the cessation of those causes.
All phenomena are merely products of causes. The world is just a
perpetual flux of natural forces incessantly interacting and changing.
Buddhism points out to us that all things are devoid of any self
entity. They are just a perpetual flux of change, which is inherently
unsatisfactory because of the lack of freedom, the subjection to
causality. This unsatisfactoriness will be brought to an end as soon as
the process stops; and the process will stop as soon as the causes are
eliminated so that there is no more interacting. This is a most
profound account of "what is what" or the nature of things, such as
only an enlightened individual could give. It is the heart of Buddhism.
It tells us that all things are just appearances and that we should not
be fooled into liking or disliking them. Rendering the mind truly free
involves escaping completely from the causal chain by utterly
eliminating the causes. In this way, the unsatisfactory condition which
results from liking and disliking will be brought to an end. Let us now
examine the Buddha's intention in becoming an ascetic. What motivated
him to become a bhikkhu? This is clearly indicated in one of his
discourses, in which he says that he left home and became a bhikkhu in
order to answer the question: "What is the Good?" The word
"good"(Kusala), as used here by the Buddha, refers to skilfulness, to
absolutely right knowledge. He wanted to know in particular what is
suffering, what is the cause of suffering, what is freedom from
suffering, and what is the method that will lead to freedom from
suffering. To attain perfect and right knowledge is the ultimate in
skill. The aim of Buddhism is nothing other this perfection of
knowledge of what is what or the true nature of things. Another
important Buddhist teaching is that of the Three Characteristics,
namely impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness or suffering (dukkha)
and non - selfhood (anatta). Not to know this teaching is not to know
Buddhism. It points out to us that all things are impermanent (anicca),
all things are unsatisfactory(dukkha), and all things are not selves
(anatta). In saying that all things are impermanent we mean that things
change perpetually, there being no entity or self remains unchanged for
even an instant. That all things are unsatisfactory means that all
things have inherent in them the property of conducing to suffering and
torment. They are inherently unlikable and disenchanting. That they are
not selves is to say that in no thing whatsoever is there any entity
which we might have a right to regard as its "self" or to call "mine."
If we grasp at things and cling to things, the result is bound to be
suffering. Things are more dangerous than fire because we can at least
see a fire blazing away and so don't go too close to it, whereas all
things are a fire we can't see. Consequently we go about voluntarily
picking up handfuls of fire which is invariably painful. This teaching
tells us what things are like in terms of the Three Characteristics.
Clearly Buddhism is simply an organized practical system designed to
show what is what.</p>
<p>We have seen that we have to know the nature of things. We
also have to know how to practice in order to fit in with the nature of
things. There is another teaching in the texts, known as the Chief of
all Teachings. It consists of three brief points: "Avoid evil, do good,
purify the mind!" This is the principle of the practice. Knowing all
things as impermanent, worthless and not our property, and so not worth
clinging to, not worth becoming infatuated with, we have to act
appropriately and cautiously with respect to them, and that is to avoid
evil. It implies not to break with accepted moral standards and to give
up excessive craving and attachment. On the other hand, one is to do
good, good as has come to be understood by wise people. These two are
simply stages in morality. The third, which tells us to make the mind
completely pure of every kind of contaminating element, is straight
Buddhism. It tells us to make the mind free. As long as the mind is not
yet free from domination by things, it cannot be a clean, pure mind.
Mental freedom must come from the most profound knowledge of the what
is what. As long as one lacks this knowledge, one is bound to go on
mindlessly liking or disliking things in one way or another. As long as
one cannot remain unmoved by things, one can hardly be called free.
Basically we human beings are subject to just two kinds of emotional
states: liking and disliking (which correspond to pleasant and
unpleasant mental feeling). We fall slaves to our moods and have no
real freedom simply because we don't know the true nature of moods or
what is what. Liking has the characteristic of seizing on things and
taking them over; disliking has the characteristic of pushing things
away and getting rid of them. As long as these two kinds of emotional
states exist, the mind is not yet free. As long as it is still
carelessly liking and disliking this, that the other, there is no way
it can be purified and freed from the tyranny of things. For this very
reason, this highest teaching of Buddhism condemns grasping and
clinging to things attractive and repulsive, ultimately condemning even
attachment good and evil. When the mind has been purified of these two
emotional reactions, it will become independent of things. Other
religions would have us simply avoid evil and grasp at goodness. They
have us grasp at and become attached to goodness, even including the
epitome of goodness, namely God. Buddhism goes much further, condemning
attachment to anything at all. This attachment to goodness is right
practice at the intermediate level, but it just can't take us to the
high level no matter what we do. At the lowest level we avoid evil, at
the intermediate level we do our utmost to do good, while at the
highest level we make the mind float high above the domination of both
good and evil. The condition of attachment to the fruits of goodness is
not yet complete liberation from suffering, because, while an evil
person suffers in a way befitting evil persons, a good person suffers
also, in a way befitting good persons. Being good, one experiences the
kind of suffering appropriate to good human beings. A good celestial
being experiences the suffering appropriate to celestial beings, and
even a god or Brahma experiences the suffering appropriate to gods. But
complete freedom from all suffering will come only when one has broken
free and transcended even that which we call goodness to become an
Aryian, one who has transcended the worldly condition, and ultimately
to become a fully perfected individual, an Arahant. Now as we have
seen, Buddhism is the teaching of the Buddha, the Enlightened One, and
a Buddhist is one who practices according to the teaching of the
Enlightened One. With regard to what was he enlightened? He simply knew
the nature of all things. Buddhism, then, is the teaching that tells us
the truth about what things are really like or what is what. It is up
to us to practice until we have come to know that truth for ourselves.
We may be sure that once that perfect knowledge has been attained,
craving will be completely destroyed by it, because ignorance will
cease to be in the very same moment that knowledge arises. Every aspect
of Buddhist practice is designed to bring knowledge. Your whole purpose
in setting your mind on the way of practice that will penetrate to
Buddha-Dhamma is simply to gain knowledge. Only, do let it be right
knowledge, knowledge attained through clear insight, not worldly
knowledge, partial knowledge, halfway knowledge, which for example
clumsily mistakes bad for good, and a source of suffering for a source
of happiness. Do try your utmost to look at things in terms of
suffering, and so come to know, gradually, step by step. Knowledge so
gained will be Buddhist knowledge based on sound Buddhist principles.
Studying by this method, even a woodcutter without book learning will
be able to penetrate to the essence of Buddhism, while a religious
scholar with several degrees, who is completely absorbed in studying
the Tipitaka but doesn't look at things from this point of view, may
not penetrate the teaching at all. Those of us who have some
intelligence should be capable of investigating and examining things
and coming to know their true nature. Each thing we come across we must
study, in order to understand clearly its true nature. And we must
understand the nature and the source of the suffering which produces,
and which sets us alight and scorches us. To establish mindfulness, to
watch and wait, to examine in the manner described the suffering that
comes to one-- this is very best way to penetrate to Buddha-Dhamma. It
is infinitely better than learning it from the Tipitaka. Busily
studying Dhamma in the Tipitaka from the linguistic or literary
viewpoint is no way to come to know the true nature of things. Of
course the Tipitaka is full of explanations as to the nature of things;
but the trouble is that people listen to it in the manner of parrots or
talking myna birds, repeating later what they have been able to
memorize. They themselves are incapable of penetrating to the true
nature of things. If instead they would do some introspection and
discover for themselves the facts of mental life, find out firsthand
the properties of the mental defilements, of suffering, of nature, in
other words of all the things in which they are involved, they would
then be able to penetrate to the real Buddha- Dhamma. Though a person
may never have seen or even heard of the Tipitaka, if he carries out
detailed investigation every time suffering arises and scorches his
mind he can be said to be studying the Tipitaka directly, and far more
correctly than people actually in the process of reading it. These may
be just caressing the books of the Tipitaka everyday without having any
knowledge of the immortal Dhamma, the teaching contained within them.
Likewise, we have ourselves, we make use of ourselves, we train
ourselves, and we do things connected with ourselves every day, without
knowing anything about ourselves, without being able to handle
adequately problems concerning ourselves. We are still very definitely
subject to suffering, and craving is still present to produce more and
more suffering every day as we grow older, all simply because we don't
know ourselves. We still don't know the mental life we live. To get to
know the Tipitaka and the profound things hidden within it is most
difficult. Let us rather set about studying Buddha-Dhamma by getting to
know our own true nature. Let us get to know all the things which make
up this very body and mind. Let us learn from this life: life which is
spinning on in the cycle of desiring, acting on the desires, and
reaping the results of the action, which then nourish the will to
desire again, and so on, over and over incessantly; life which is
obliged to go spinning on in the circle of samsara, that sea of
suffering, purely and simply because of ignorance as to the true nature
of things or what is what. Summing up, Buddhism is an organized
practical system designed to reveal to us the "what is what." Once we
have seen things as they really are, we no longer need anyone to teach
or guide us. We can carry on practising by ourselves. One progresses
along the Aryian Path just as rapidly as one eliminates the defilements
and gives up inappropriate action. Ultimately one will attain to the
best thing possible for a human being, what we call the Fruit of the
Path, Nirvana. This one can do by oneself simply by means of coming to
know the ultimate sense of the "what is what."</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Chapter 3: &nbsp;Three Universal Characteristics</a></p>

<p>We shall now discuss in detail the three characteristics
common to all things, namely impermanence, unsatisfactoriness
(suffering) and non-selfhood.</p>
<p>All things whatsoever have the property of changing incessantly; they
are unstable. All things whatsoever have the characteristic of
unsatisfactoriness; seeing them evokes disillusionment and
disenchantment in anyone having clear insight into their nature.
Nothing whatsoever is such that we are justified in regarding it as
"mine." To our normally imperfect vision, things appear as selves; but
as soon as our vision becomes clear, unobscured and accurate, we
realize that there is no self-entity present in any of them.</p>
<p>These three characteristics were the aspect of the teaching
which the Buddha stressed more than any other. The entire teaching when
summed up amounts simply to insight into impermanence,
unsatisfactoriness and non-selfhood. Sometimes they are mentioned
explicitly, sometimes they are expressed in other terms, but
fundamentally they aim at demonstrating the same single truth. The
impermanence of all things had been taught before the time of the
Buddha, but it had not been expounded as profoundly as it was by the
Buddha. Unsatisfactoriness, likewise, had been taught but not in its
full depth. It had not been treated from the point of view of
causation, and no directions had been given as to how it could be
thoroughly and completely done away with.</p>
<p>Earlier teachers had not understood its true nature as did the Buddha
in his enlightenment. As for non-selfhood in the ultimate sense, this
is taught only in Buddhism This doctrine tells us that a person who has
complete understanding of the "what is what" or the nature of things
will know that nothing whatsoever is a self or belongs to a self. This
was taught only by the Buddha, who truly had a complete and thorough
understanding of the "what is what" or the true nature of things. The
ways of practice designed to bring about insight in these three
characteristics are numerous; but one single noteworthy fact is bound
to be revealed once that perfect insight has been attained, namely the
fact that nothing is worth grasping at or clinging to. There is nothing
that we should want to get, to have, to be. In short: nothing is worth
getting; nothing is worth being. Only when one has come to perceive
that having anything or being anything is a delusion, a deception, a
mirage, and that nothing at all is worth getting or worth being, has
one achieved true insight into impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and
non-selfhood. A man may have been reciting the formula: "anicca,
dukkha, anatta" morning and evening hundreds and thousands of times and
yet not be able to perceive these characteristics. It is just not in
their nature to be perceptible through hearing or reciting.</p>
<p>Now intuitive insight, or what we call "seeing Dhamma," is not
by any means the same thing as rational thinking. One will never come
to see Dhamma by means of rational thinking. Intuitive insight can be
gained only by means of a true inner realization. For instance, suppose
we are examining a situation where we had thoughtlessly become quite
wrapped up in something which later caused us suffering. If, on looking
closely at the actual course of events, we become genuinely fed up,
disillusioned and disenchanted with that thing, we can be said to have
seen Dhamma, or to have gained clear insight. This clear insight may
develop in time until it is perfected, and has the power to bring
liberation from all things. If a person recites aloud: "anicca, dukkha,
anatta" or examines these characteristics day and night without ever
becoming disenchanted with things, without ever losing the desire to
get things or to be something, or the desire to cling to things, that
person has not yet attained to insight. In short, then, insight into
impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and non-selfhood amounts to realizing
that nothing is worth getting or worth being.</p>
<p>There is a word in Buddhism that covers this completely, the
word sunnata, or emptiness, emptiness of selfhood, emptiness of any
essence that we might have a right to cling to with all our might as
being "mine." Observation, which leads to the insight that all things
are devoid of any essence that is worth clinging to is the real core of
the religion. It is the key to Buddhist practice. When we have come to
know clearly that everything of every kind is devoid of selfhood we can
be said to know Buddha-Dhamma in its entirety. The single phrase "empty
of self" sums up the words "impermanent (anicca), unsatisfactory
(dukkha) and not self (anatta)." When something is perpetually
changing, devoid of any permanent unchanging element, it can also be
said to be empty. When it is seen to be overflowing with the property
of inducing disillusionment, it can be described as empty of any entity
that we might have a right to cling to. And when we discover on
examination that it possesses no stable component whatever that could
be "self," that it is simply nature, changing and fluctuating in
accordance with the laws of nature, which we have no right to call a
self, then it can be described as empty of self. As soon as any
individual has come to perceive the emptiness of things, there arises
in him the realization that it is not worth getting or being any of
those things. This feeling of not desiring to get or to be has the
power to protect one from falling slave, to the defilements or to any
kind of emotional involvement. Once an individual has attained this
condition, he is thenceforth incapable of any unwholesome state of
mind. He does become carried away by or involved in anything. He does
not become in any way attracted or seduced by anything. His mind knows
permanent liberty and independence, and is free from suffering.</p>
<p>The statement "Nothing is worth getting or being" is to be
understood in a rather special sense. The words "get" and "be" refer
here to getting and being with a deluded mind, with a mind that grasps
and clings wholly and entirely. It is not suggested that one could live
without having or being an thing at all. Normally there are certain
things one can't do without. One needs property, children, wife,
garden, field and so on. One is to be good, one can't help being a
winner or a loser, or having some status or other. One can't help being
something or other. Why then are we taught to regard things as not
worth getting or being? The answer is this: the concepts of getting and
being are purely relative; they are worldly ideas based on ignorance.
Speaking in terms of pure reality, or absolute truth, we cannot get or
be anything at all. And why? Simply because both the person who is to
do the getting and the thing that is to be got are impermanent,
unsatisfactory (suffering) and nobody's property. But an individual who
doesn't perceive this will naturally think "I am getting..., I have...,
I am...." We automatically think in these terms, and it is this very
concept of getting and being that is the source of distress and misery.</p>
<p>Getting and being represent a form of desire, namely the
desire not to let the thing that one is in the process of getting or
being disappear or slip away. Suffering arises from desire to have and
desire to be, in short, from desire; and desire arises from failure to
realize that all things are inherently undesirable. The false idea that
things are desirable is present as an instinct right from babyhood and
is the cause of desire. Consequent on the desire there come about
results of one sort or another, which may or may not accord with the
desire. If the desired result is obtained, there will arise a still
greater desire. If the desired result is not obtained, there is bound
to follow a struggling and striving until one way or another it is
obtained. Keeping this up results in the vicious circle: action
(karma), result, action, result, which is known as the Wheel of
Samsara. Now this word samsara is not to be taken as referring to an
endless cycle of one physical existence after another. In point of fact
it refers to a vicious circle of three events: desire; action in
keeping with the desire; effect resulting from that action; inability
to stop desiring, having to desire once more; action; once again
another effect; further augmenting of desire ... and so on endlessly.
Buddha called this the "Wheel" of samsara because it is endless cycling
on, a rolling on. It is because of this very circle that we are obliged
to endure suffering and torment. To succeed in breaking loose from this
vicious circle is to attain freedom from all forms of suffering, in
other words Nirvana. Regardless of whether a person is a pauper or a
millionaire, a king or an emperor, a celestial being or a god, or
anything at all, as long as he is caught up in this vicious circle, he
is obliged to experience suffering and torment of one kind or another,
in keeping with his desire. We can say then that this wheel of samsara
is well and truly overloaded with suffering. For the rectifying of this
situation morality is quite inadequate. To resolve the problem we have
to depend on the highest principles of Dhamma.</p>
<p>We have seen that suffering has its origins in desire, which
is just what the Buddha set out in the Second Noble Truth. Now there
are three kinds of desire. The first kind is sensual desire, desiring
and finding pleasure in things: in shapes and colors, sounds, scents,
tastes, or tactile objects. The second kind is desire for becoming,
desire to be this or that according to what one wants. The third kind
is desire not to become, desire not to be this or that. That there are
just these three kinds of desire is an absolute rule. Anyone is defied
to challenge this rule and demonstrate the existence of a kind of
desire other than these three.</p>
<p>Anyone can observe that wherever there is desire, there
distress is too; and when we are forced to act on a desire, we are
bound to suffer again in accordance with the action. Having got the
result, we are unable to put an end to our desire, so we carry right on
desiring. The reason we are obliged to continue experiencing distress
is that we are not yet free from desire, but are still slaves to it.
Thus it can be said that an evil man does evil because he desires to do
evil, and experiences the kind of suffering appropriate to the nature
of an evil man; and that a good man desires to do good, and so is bound
to experience another kind of suffering, a kind appropriate to the
nature of a good man. But don't understand this as teaching us to give
up doing good. It is simply teaching us to realize that there exist
degrees of suffering so fine that the average man cannot detect them.
We have to act on the Buddha's advice: if we are to break free from
suffering completely, simply doing good is not sufficient. It is
necessary to do things beyond and above the doing of good, things that
will serve to free the mind from the condition of serfdom and slavery
to desire of any kind. This is the quintessence of the Buddha's
teaching. It cannot be bettered or equalled by any other religion in
the world, so ought to be carefully remembered. To succeed in
overcoming these three forms of desire is to attain complete liberation
from suffering.</p>
<p>How can we eliminate desire, extinguish it, cut it out at its roots and
put an end to it for good? The answer to this is simply: observe and
take note of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness (suffering) and
non-selfhood until we come to see that there is nothing worth desiring.
What is there worth getting or being? What is there such that when a
person has got it or becomes it, it fails to give rise to some kind of
suffering? Ask yourself this question: What is there that you can get
or be that will not bring distress and anxiety? Think it over. Does
having a wife and children lead to lightheartedness and freedom or does
it bring all sorts of responsibilities? Is the gaining of high position
and title the gaining of peace and calm or the gaining of heavy
obligations? Looking at things in this way, we readily see that these
things always bring only burden and responsibility. And why? Everything
whatsoever is a burden simply by virtue of its characteristics of
impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and non selfhood. Having got
something, we have to see to it that it stays with us, is as we wish it
to be, or is of benefit to us. But that thing is by nature impermanent
unsatisfactory and nobody's property. It cannot conform to the aims and
objectives of anyone. It will only change as is its nature. All our
efforts, then, are an attempt to oppose and withstand the law of
change; and life, as an attempt to make things conform to our wishes,
is fraught with difficulty suffering.</p>
<p>There exists a technique for coming to realize that nothing at
all is worth getting or being. It consists in examining things deeply
enough to discover that in the presence of craving one has feelings of
a certain kind towards getting and being; that when desire has given
way completely to insight into the true nature of things, one's
attitude towards getting and being is rather different. As an easy
example let us consider eating. One man's eating accompanied by craving
and desire for delicious tastes must have certain features that
distinguish it from another man's eating, which is accompanied not by
desire, but by clear comprehension, or insight into the true nature of
things. Their eating manners must differ, their feelings while eating
must differ, and so must the results arising from their eating.</p>
<p>Now what we have to realize is that one can still eat food
even though one lacks all craving for delicious tastes. The Buddha and
Arahants, individuals devoid of craving, were still able to do things
and be things. They were still able to do work, far more in fact than
any of us can with all our desires. What was the power by virtue of
which they did it? What corresponded to the power of craving, of
desiring to be this or that, by virtue of which we do things? The
answer is that they did it by the power of insight, clear and thorough
knowledge of what is what or the true nature of things. We by contrast
are motivated by desire, with the result that we are, unlike them,
continually subject to suffering. They did not desire to get or possess
anything, and as a result others were benefited thanks to their
benevolence. Their wisdom told them to make it known rather than remain
indifferent, and so they were able to pass the teaching on to us.</p>
<p>Freedom from craving brings many incidental benefits. A body and mind
freed from craving can look for and partake of food motivated by
intelligent discrimination and not, as before, by desire. If we wish to
break free from suffering, following the footsteps of the Buddha and
the arahants, then we must train ourselves to act with discrimination
rather than with craving. If you are a student, then learn how to
distinguish right from wrong, good from bad, and verify that studying
is the very best thing for you to be doing. If you have a job of some
kind, then learn how to distinguish right from wrong, good from bad,
and satisfy yourself that that job is the best thing for you to be
doing, and of benefit to all concerned. Then do it well, and with all
the coolness and equanimity your insight provides. If, in doing
something, we are motivated by desire, then we worry while doing it and
we worry when we have finished; but if we do it with the guiding power
of discrimination, we shall not be worried at all. This is the
difference it makes.</p>
<p>It is essential, then, that we be always aware that, in reality all
things are impermanent, unsatisfactory and not selves, that is, that
they are not worth getting or being. If we are to become involved in
them, then let us do so with discrimination and our actions will not be
contaminated with desire. If we act wisely, we shall be free of
suffering right from beginning to end. The mind will not blindly grasp
at and cling to things as worth getting and being. We shall be sure to
act with wakefulness, and be able to proceed in accordance with
tradition and custom, or in accordance with the law. For example,
though we may own land and property, we need not necessarily have any
greedy feelings about them. We need not cling to things to the extent
that they become a burden, weighing down and tormenting the mind. The
law is bound to see to it that our piece of land remains in our
possession. We don't need to suffer worry and anxiety about it. It
isn't going to slip through our fingers and disappear. Even if someone
comes along and snatches it from us, we can surely still resist and
protect it intelligently. We can resist without becoming angry, without
letting ourselves become heated with the flame of hatred. We can depend
on the law and do our resisting without any need to experience
suffering. Certainly we ought to watch over our property; but if it
should in fact slip out of our grip, then becoming emotional about it
won't help matters at all. All things are impermanent, perpetually
changing. Realizing this, we need not become upset about anything.</p>
<p>"Being" is the same. There is no need to cling to one's state
of being this or that, because in reality there is no satisfactory
condition at all. All conditions bring about suffering of one kind or
another. There is a very simple technique, which we must have a look at
later, known as vipassana, the direct practice of Dhamma. It consists
of close introspection, which reveals that there is nothing worth
being, or that there is really no satisfactory state of being at all.
Have a look at this question yourself; see if you can discover any
satisfactory condition or state of being. Being a son? a parent?
husband? wife? master? servant? Is any of these agreeable? Even being
the man with the advantage, the one with the upper hand, the winner--is
that agreeable? Is the condition of a human being agreeable? Even the
condition of a celestial being or a god--would that be agreeable? When
you have really come to know the what is what, you find that nothing
whatsoever is in any way agreeable. We are making do with mindlessly
getting and being. But why should we go risking life and limb by
getting and being blindly, always acting on desire? It behoves us to
understand things and live wisely, involving ourselves in things in
such a way that they cause a minimum of suffering, or ideally, none at
all.</p>
<p>Here is another point: we must bring to our fellow men, our friends,
and particularly our relatives and those close to us, the understanding
that this is how things are, so that they may have the same right view
as we have. There will then be no upsets in the family, the town, the
country, and ultimately in the whole world. Each individual mind will
be immune to desire, neither grasping at nor becoming wrapped up in
anything or anyone. Instead everyone's life will be guided by insight,
by the ever-present, unobscured vision that there is in reality nothing
that we can grasp at and cling to. Everyone will come to realize that
all things are impermanent, unsatisfactory and devoid of any
self-entity, that none of them are worth becoming infatuated with. It
is up to us to have the sense to give them up, to have right views, in
keeping with the Buddha's teaching. A person who has done this is fit
to be called a true Buddhist. Though he may never have been ordained
nor even taken the precepts, he will have truly penetrated to Buddha,
Dhamma and Sangha. His mind will be identical with that of Buddha,
Dhamma and Sangha. It will be uncontaminated, enlightened and tranquil,
simply by virtue of not grasping at anything as worth getting or worth
being. So a person can readily become a genuine, full-fledged Buddhist
simply by means of this technique of being observant, perceiving
impermanence, unsatisfactoriness selfhood until he comes to realize
that there is nothing worth getting or being.</p>
<p>The lowest forms of evil originate in and are powered by desire to get
and to be; milder forms of evil consist of actions less strongly
motivated by desire; and all goodness consists of action based on the
finest, most tenuous sort of desire, the desire to get or to be, on a
good level. Even in its highest forms, good is based on desire which,
however, is so fine and tenuous that people don't consider it in any
way a bad thing. The fact is, however, that good action can never bring
complete freedom from suffering. A person who has become free from
desire, that is to say an Arahant, is one who has ceased acting on
desire and has become incapable of doing evil. His actions lie outside
the categories of good and evil. His mind is free and has transcended
the limitations of good and evil. Thus he is completely free of
suffering. This is a fundamental principle of Buddhism. Whether or not
we are able to do it or wish to do it, this is the way to liberation
from suffering. Today we may not yet want it; some day we are bound to
want it. When we have completely given up evil and have done good to
our utmost, the mind will still be weighed down with various kinds of
attenuated desire, and there is no known way of getting rid of them
other than by striving to go beyond the power of desire, to go beyond
the desire to get or be anything, bad or good. If there is to be
Nirvana, freedom from suffering of every kind, there has to be absolute
and complete absence of desire.</p>
<p>In short, to know what is what in the ultimate sense is to see
everything as impermanent, unsatisfactory and devoid of selfhood. When
we really know this, the mind comes to see things in such a way that it
does not cling to get or to be anything. But if we have to become
involved in things in the ways known as "having" and "being," then we
become involved intelligently, motivated by insight, and not by desire.
Acting thus, we remain free from suffering.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Chapter 4: &nbsp;Grasping And Clinging</a></p>

<p>How can we get away from and become completely independent of
things, all of which are transient, unsatisfactory and devoid of
selfhood? The answer is that we have to find out what is the cause of
our desiring those things and clinging to them. Knowing that cause, we
shall be in a position to eliminate clinging completely. Buddhists
recognize four different kinds of clinging or attachment. 1) Sensual
attachment (Kamupanana) is clinging to attractive and desirable sense
objects. It is the attachment that we naturally develop for things we
like and find satisfaction in: colors and shapes, sounds, odours,
tastes, tactile objects, or mental images, objects past, present, or
future that arise in the mind, and either correspond to material
objects in the world outside or within the body, or are just
imaginings. We instinctively find pleasure, enchantment, delight in
these six kinds of sense objects. They induce delight and enchantment
in the mind perceiving them.</p>
<p>As soon as an individual is born, he comes to know the taste
of these six sense objects, and clings to them; and as time passes he
becomes more and more firmly attached to them. Ordinary people are
incapable of withdrawing from them again, so they present a major
problem. It is necessary to have a proper knowledge and understanding
of these sense objects and to act appropriately with respect to them,
otherwise clinging to them may lead to complete and utter dereliction.
If we examine the case history of any person who has sunk into
dereliction, we always find that it has come about through his clinging
fast to some desirable sense object. Actually every single thing a
human being does has its origin in sensuality. Whether we love, become
angry, hate, feel envious, murder, or commit suicide, the ultimate
cause must be some sense object. If we investigate what is it that
drives human beings to work energetically, or to do anything at all for
that matter, we find it is desire, desire to get things of one kind or
another. People strive, study, and earn what money they can, and then
go off in search of pleasure-in the form of colors and shapes, sounds,
odors, tastes, and tactile objects-which is what keeps them going. Even
merit making in order to go to heaven has its origins simply in a wish
based on sensuality. Taken together, all the trouble and chaos in the
world has its origin in sensuality. The danger of sensuality lies in
the power of sensual attachment. For this reason the Buddha reckoned
clinging to sensuality as the primary form of attachment. It is a real
world problem. Whether the world is to be completely destroyed, or
whatever is to happen, is bound to depend on this very sensual
clinging. It behooves us to examine ourselves to find out in what ways
we are attached to sensuality and how firmly, and whether it is not
perhaps within our power to give it up. Speaking in worldly terms,
attachment to sensuality is a very good thing. It conduces to family
love, to diligence and energy in the search for wealth and fame, and so
on. But if looked at from the spiritual point of view, it is seen to be
the secret en trance for suffering and torment. Spiritually speaking,
attachment to sensuality is something to be kept under control. And if
all suffering is to be eliminated, sensual attachment has to be done
away with completely. 2) Attachment to opinions (Ditthupadana).
Clinging to views and opinions is not difficult to detect and identify
once we do a little introspection. Ever since we were born into the
world, we have been receiving instruction and training, which has given
rise to ideas and opinions. In speaking here of opinions, what we have
in mind is the kind of ideas one hangs on to and refuses to let go of.
To cling to one's own ideas and opinions is quite natural and is not
normally condemned or disapproved of. But it is no less grave a danger
than attachment to attractive and desirable objects. It can happen that
preconceived ideas and opinions to which we had always clung
obstinately come to be destroyed. For this reason it is necessary that
we continually amend our views, making them progressively more correct,
better, higher, changing false views into views that are closer and
closer to the truth, and ultimately into the kind of views that
incorporate the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p>Obstinate and stubborn opinions have various origins, but in
the main they are bound up with customs, traditions, ceremonies and
religious doctrines. Stubborn personal convictions are not a matter of
great importance. They are far less numerous than convictions stemming
from long held popular traditions and ceremonies. Adherence to views is
based on ignorance. Lacking knowledge, we develop our own personal
views on things, based on our own original stupidity. For instance, we
are convinced that things are desirable and worth clinging to, that
they really endure, are worthwhile and are selves, instead of
perceiving that they are just a delusion and a deception, transient,
worthless and devoid of selfhood. Once we have come to have certain
ideas about something, we naturally don't like to admit later on that
we were mistaken. Even though we may occasionally see that we are
wrong, we simply refuse to admit it. Obstinacy of this sort is to be
considered a major obstacle to progress, rendering us incapable of
changing for the better, incapable of modifying false religious
convictions and other longstanding beliefs. This is likely to be a
problem for people who hold to naive doctrines. Even though they may
later come to see them as naive, they refuse to change on the grounds
that their parents, grandparents and ancestors all held those same
views. Or if they are not really interested in correcting and improving
themselves, they may simply brush away any arguments against their old
ideas with the remark that this is what they have always believed. For
these very reasons, attachment to opinions is to be considered a
dangerous defilement, a major danger, which, if we are to better
ourselves at all, we ought to make all efforts to eliminate. 3)
Attachment to rites and rituals (Silabbatupadana). This refers to
clinging to meaningless traditional practices that have been
thoughtlessly handed down, practices which people choose to regard as
sacred and not to be changed under any circumstances. In Thailand there
is no less of this sort of thing than in other places. There are
beliefs involving amulets, magical artifacts and all manner of secret
procedures. There exist, for instance, the beliefs that on rising from
sleep one must pronounce a mystical formula over water and then wash
one's face in it, that before relieving nature one must turn and face
this and that point of the compass, and that before one partakes of
food or goes to sleep there have to be other rituals. There are beliefs
in spirits and celestial beings, in sacred trees and all manner of
magical objects. This sort of thing is completely irrational. People
just don't think rationally; they simply cling to the established
pattern. They have always done it that way and they just refuse to
change. Many people professing to be Buddhists cling to these beliefs
as well and so have it both ways; and this even includes some who call
themselves bhikkhus, disciples of the Buddha. Religious doctrines based
on belief in God, angels and sacred objects are particularly prone to
these kinds of views; there is no reason why we Buddhists should not be
completely free of this sort of thing.</p>
<p>The reason we have to be free of such views is that if we
practice any aspect of Dhamma unaware of its original purpose,
unconscious of the rationale of it, the result is bound to be the
foolish, naive assumption that it is something magical. Thus we find
people taking upon themselves the moral precepts or practicing Dhamma,
purely and simply to conform with the accepted pattern, the traditional
ceremonial, just to follow the example that has been handed down. They
know nothing of the rationale of these things, doing them just out of
force of habit. Such firmly established clinging is hard to correct.
This is what is meant by thoughtless attachment to traditional
practices. Insight meditation or tranquillity meditation as practiced
nowadays, if carried out without any knowledge of rhyme and reason and
the real objectives of it, is bound to motivated by grasping and
clinging, misdirected, and just some kind of foolishness. And even the
taking of the Precepts, five, eight, or ten, or however many, if done
in the belief that one will thereby become a magical, supernatural,
holy individual possessing psychic or other powers, becomes just
misdirected routine, motivated simply by attachment to rite and ritual.</p>
<p>It is necessary, then, that we be very cautious. Buddhist
practice must have a sound foundation in thought and understanding and
desire to destroy the defilements. Otherwise it will be just
foolishness; it will be misdirected, irrational a just a waste of time.
4) Attachment to the idea of selfhood (Attavadupadana). The belief in
selfhood is something important and also something extremely well
concealed. Any living creature is always bound to have the wrong idea
of "me and mine." This is the primal instinct of living things and is
the basis of all other instincts. For example, the instinct to seek
food and eat it, the instinct to avoid danger, the instinct to
procreate, and many others consist simply in the creature's instinctive
awareness of a belief in its own selfhood. Convinced first of all of
its own selfhood, it will naturally desire to avoid death, to search
for food and nourish its body, to seek safety, and to propagate the
species. A belief in selfhood is, then, universally present in all
living things. If it were not so, they could not continue to survive.
At the same time, however, it is what causes suffering in the search
for food and shelter, in the propagation of the species, or in any
activity whatsoever. This is one reason why the Buddha taught that
attachment to the self-idea is the root cause of all suffering. He
summed it up very briefly by saying: "Things, if clung to, are
suffering, or are a source of suffering." This attachment is the source
and basis of life; at the same time it is the source and basis of
suffering in all its forms. It was this very fact that the Buddha was
referring to when he said that life is suffering; suffering is life.
This means the body and mind (five aggregates) which are clung to are
suffering. Knowledge of the source and basis of life and of suffering
is to be considered the most profound and most penetrating knowledge,
since it puts us in a position to eliminate suffering completely. This
piece of knowledge can be claimed to be unique to Buddhism. It is not
to be found in any other religion in the world. The most efficacious
way of dealing with attachment is to recognize it whenever it is
present. This applies most particularly to attachment to the idea of
selfhood, which is the very basis of life. It is something that comes
into existence of its own accord, establishing itself in us without our
needing to be taught it. It is present as an instinct in children and
the small offspring of animals right from birth. Baby animals such as
kittens know how to assume a defensive attitude, as we can see when we
try to approach them. There is always that something, the "self"
present in the mind, and consequently this attachment is bound to
manifest. The only thing to do is to rein it in as much as possible
until such time as one is well advanced in spiritual knowledge; in
other words, to employ Buddhist principles until this instinct has been
overcome and completely eliminated. As long as one is still an ordinary
person, a worldling, this instinct remains unconquered. Only the
highest of the Aryians, the Arahant, has succeeded in defeating it. We
must recognize this as a matter of no small importance; it is a major
problem common to all living creatures. If we are to be real Buddhists,
if we are to derive the full benefits from the teaching, it is up to us
to set about overcoming this misconception. The suffering to which we
are subject will diminish accordingly.</p>
<p>To know the truth about these things, which are of everyday
concern to us, is to be regarded as one of the greatest boons, one of
the greatest skills. Do give some thought to this matter of the four
attachments, bearing in mind that nothing whatever is worth clinging
to, that by the nature of things, nothing is worth getting or being.
That we are completely enslaved by things is simply a result of these
four kinds of attachment. It rests with us to examine and become
thoroughly familiar with the highly dangerous and toxic nature of
things. Their harmful nature is not immediately evident as is the case
with a blazing fire, weapons, or poison. They are well disguised as
sweet, tasty, fragrant, alluring things, beautiful things, melodious
things. Coming in these forms they are bound to be difficult to
recognize and deal with. Consequently we have to make use of this
knowledge the Buddha has equipped us with. We have to control this
unskillful grasping and subdue it by the power of insight. Doing this,
we shall be in a position to organize our life in such a way that it
becomes free of suffering, free of even the smallest trace of
suffering. We shall be capable of working and living peacefully in the
world, of being undefiled, enlightened and tranquil.</p>
<p>Let us sum up. These four forms of attachment are the only
problem that Buddhists or people who wish to know about Buddhism have
to understand. The objective of living a holy life (Brahmacariya) in
Buddhism is to enable the mind to give up unskillful grasping. You can
find this teaching in every discourse in the texts which treats of the
attainment of arahantship. The expression used is "the mind freed from
attachment." That is the ultimate. When the mind is free from
attachment, there is nothing to bind it and make it a slave of the
world. There is nothing to keep it spinning on in the cycle of birth
and death, so the whole process comes to a stop, or rather, becomes
world transcending, free from the world. The giving up of unskillful
clinging is, then, the key to Buddhist practice.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Chapter 5: &nbsp;The Threefold Training</a></p>

<p>In this chapter we shall examine the method to be used for
eliminating clinging. The method is based on three practical steps,
namely Morality, Concentration, and Insight, known collectively as the
Threefold Training. The first step is morality (Sila). Morality is
simply suitable behavior, behavior that conforms with the generally
accepted standards and causes no distress to other people or to
oneself. It is coded in the form of five moral precepts, or eight, or
ten, or 227, or in other ways. It is conducted by way of body and
speech aimed at peace, convenience and freedom from undesirable effects
at the most basic level. It has to do with the members of a social
group and the various pieces of property essential to living. The
second aspect of the threefold training is concentration (Samadhi).
This consists in constraining the mind to remain in the condition most
conducive to success in whatever he wishes to achieve. Just what is
concentration? No doubt most of you have always understood
concentration as implying a completely tranquil mind, as steady and
unmoving as a log of wood. But merely these two characteristics of
being tranquil and steady are not the real meaning of Concentration.
The basis for this statement is an utterance of the Buddha. He
described the concentrated mind as fit for work (kammaniya), in a
suitable condition for doing its job. Fit for work is the very best way
to describe the properly concentrated mind. The third aspect is the
training in insight (Panna), the practice and drill that gives rise to
the full measure of right knowledge and understanding of the true
nature of all things. Normally we are incapable of knowing anything at
all in its true nature. Mostly we either stick to our own ideas or go
along with popular opinion, so that what we see is not the truth at
all. It is for this reason that Buddhist practice includes this
training in insight, the last aspect of the threefold training,
designed to give rise to full understanding of and insight into the
true nature of things.</p>
<p>In the religious context, understanding and insight are not by
any means the same. Understanding depends to some extent on the use of
reasoning, on rational intellection. Insight goes further than that. An
object known by insight has been absorbed; it has been penetrated to
and confronted face to face; the mind has become thoroughly absorbed in
it through examination and investigation so sustained that there has
arisen a non-rational but genuine and heartfelt disenchantment with
that thing and a complete lack of emotional involvement in it.
Consequently the Buddhist training in insight does not refer to
intellectual understanding of the kind used in present day academic and
scholarly circles, where each individual can have his own particular
kind of truth. Buddhist insight must be intuitive insight clear and
immediate, the result of having penetrated to the object by one means
or another, until it has made a definite and indelible impression on
the mind. For this reason the objects of scrutiny in insight training
must be things that one comes into contact with in the course of
everyday living; or at least they must be things of sufficient
importance to render the mind genuinely fed up and disenchanted with
them as transient, unsatisfactory and not selves. However much we think
rationally, evaluating the characteristics of transience,
unsatisfactoriness and non-selfhood, nothing results but intellectual
understanding. There is no way it can give rise to disillusionment and
disenchantment with worldly things. It must be understood that the
condition of disenchantment replaces that of desiring the formerly
infatuatingly attractive object, and that this in itself constitutes
the insight. It is a fact of nature that the presence of genuine, clear
insight implies the presence of genuine disenchantment. It is
impossible that the process should stop short at the point of clear
insight. Disenchantment displaces desire for the object, and is bound
to arise immediately. Training in morality is simply elementary
preparatory practice, which enables us to live happily and helps
stabilize the mind. Morality yields various benefits, the most
important being the preparing of the way for concentration. Other
advantages, such as conducing to happiness or to rebirth as a celestial
being, were not considered by the Buddha to be the direct aims of
morality. He regarded morality as primarily a means of inducing and
developing concentration. As long as things continue to disturb the
mind, it can never become concentrated. Training in concentration
consists in developing the ability to control this mind of ours, to
make use of it, to make it do its job to the best advantage. Morality
is good behavior in respect of body and speech; concentration amounts
to good behavior in respect of the mind, and is the fruit of thorough
mental training and discipline. The concentrated mind is devoid of all
bad, defiling thoughts and does not wander off the object. It is in a
fit condition to do its job. Even in ordinary worldly situations,
concentration is always a necessity. No matter what we are engaged in,
we can hardly do it successfully unless the mind is concentrated. For
this reason the Buddha counted concentration as one of the marks of a
great man. Regardless of whether a man is to be successful in worldly
or in spiritual things, the faculty of concentration is absolutely
indispensable. Take even a schoolboy. If he lacks concentration, how
can he do arithmetic? The sort of concentration involved in doing
arithmetic is natural concentration and is only poorly developed.
Concentration as a basic element in Buddhist practice, which is what we
are discussing here, is concentration that has been trained and raised
to a higher pitch than can develop naturally. Consequently, when the
mind has been trained successfully, it comes to have a great many very
special abilities, powers and attributes. A person who has managed to
derive these benefits from concentration can be said to have moved up a
step towards knowing the secrets of nature. He knows how to control the
mind, and thus has abilities not possessed by the average person. The
perfection of morality is an ordinary human ability. Even if someone
makes a display of morality, it is never a superhuman display. On the
other hand the attainment of deep concentration was classed by the
Buddha as a superhuman ability, which the bhikkhus were never to make a
display of. Anyone who did show off this ability was considered no
longer a good bhikkhu, or even no longer a bhikkhu at all. To attain
concentration necessitates making sacrifices. We have to put up with
varying degrees of hardship, to train and practice, until we have the
degree of concentration appropriate to our abilities. Ultimately we
shall gain much better results in our work than can the average man,
simply because we have better tools at our disposal. So do take an
interest in this matter of concentration and don't go regarding it as
something foolish and old-fashioned. It is definitely something of the
greatest importance, something worth making use of at all times,
especially nowadays when the world seems to be spinning too fast and on
the point of going up in flames. There is far more need for
concentration now than there was in the time of the Buddha. Don't get
the idea that it is just something for the people in temples, or for
cranks. Now we come to the connection between the training in
concentration and the training in insight. The Buddha once said that
when the mind is concentrated, it is in a position to see all things as
they really are. When the mind is concentrated and fit for work, it
will know all things in their true nature. lt is a strange thing that
the answer to any problem a person is trying to solve is usually
already present, though concealed, in his very own mind. He is not
aware of it, because it is still only subconscious; and as long as he
is set on solving the problem, the solution will not come, simply
because his mind at that time is not in a fit condition for solving
problems. If, when setting about any mental work, a person develops
right concentration, that is, if he renders his mind fit for work, the
solution to his problem will come to light of its own accord. The
moment the mind has become concentrated, the answer will just fall into
place. But should the solution still fail to come, there exists another
method for directing the mind to the examination of the problem, namely
the practice of concentrated introspection referred to as the training
in insight. On the day of his enlightenment the Buddha attained insight
into the Law of Conditioned Origination, that is, he came to perceive
the true nature of things or the "what is what" and the sequence in
which they arise, as a result of being concentrated in the way we have
just described. The Buddha has related the story in detail, but
essentially it amounts to this: as soon as his mind was well
concentrated, it was in a position to examine the problem.</p>
<p>It is just when the mind is quiet and cool, in a state of
well- being, undisturbed, well concentrated and fresh, that some
solution to a persistent problem is arrived at. Insight is always
dependent on concentration though we may perhaps never have noticed the
fact. Actually the Buddha demonstrated an association even more
intimate than this between concentration and insight. He pointed out
that concentration is indispensable for insight, and insight,
indispensable for concentration at a higher intensity than occurs
naturally, requires the presence of understanding of certain
characteristics of the mind. 0ne must know in just which way the mind
has to be controlled in order that concentration may be induced. So the
more insight a person has, the higher degree of concentration he will
capable of. Likewise an increase in concentration results in a
corresponding increase in insight. Either one of the two factors
promotes the other. Insight implies unobscured vision and consequently
disenchantment and boredom. It results in a backing away from all the
things one has formerly been madly infatuated with. If one has insight,
yet still goes rushing after things, madly craving for them, grasping
at and clinging on to them, being infatuated with them., then it cannot
be insight in the Buddhist sense. This stopping short and backing away
is, of course, not a physical action. One doesn't actually pick things
up and hurl them away or smash them to pieces, nor does one go running
off to live in the forest. This is not what is meant. Here we are
referring specifically to a mental stopping short and backing away, as
a result of which the mind ceases to be a slave to things and becomes a
free mind instead. This is what it is like when desire for things has
given way to disenchantment. It isn't a matter of going and committing
suicide, or going off to live as a hermit in the forest, or setting
fire to everything. Outwardly one is as usual, behaving quite normally
with respect to things. Inwardly, however, there is a difference. The
mind is independent, free, no longer a slave to things. This is the
virtue of insight. The Buddha called this effect Deliverance, escape
from slavery to things, in particular the things we like. Actually we
are enslaved by the things we dislike too. We are enslaved insofar as
we cannot help disliking them and are unable to remain unmoved by them.
In disliking things, we are being active, we are becoming emotional
about them. They manage to control us just as do the things we like,
affecting each of us in a different way. So the expression "slavery to
things" refers to the reactions of liking and disliking. All this shows
that we can escape from slavery to things and become free by means of
insight. The Buddha summed up this principle very briefly by saying:
"Insight is the means by which we can purify ourselves." He did not
specify morality or concentration as the means by which we could purify
ourselves, but insight, which enables us to escape, which liberates us
from things. Not freed from things, one is impure, tainted, infatuated,
passionate. Once free, one is pure, spotless, enlightened, tranquil.
This is the fruit of insight, the condition that results when insight
has done its job completely. Have a good look at this factor, insight,
the third aspect of the threefold training. Get to know it, and you
will come to regard it as the highest virtue. Buddhist insight is
insight that results in backing away from things by completely
destroying the four kinds of attachment. Those four attachments are
ropes holding us fast; insight is the knife that can cut those bonds
and set us free. With the four attachments gone, there is nothing left
to bind us fast to things. Will these three modes of practice stand the
test? Are they soundly based and suitable for all in practice? Do
examine them. When you have another look at them you will see that
these three factors do not conflict with any religious doctrine at all,
assuming that the religion in question really aims at remedying the
problem of human suffering. The Buddhist teaching does not conflict
with any other religion, yet it has some things that no other religion
has. In particular it has the practice of insight, which is the
superlative technique for eliminating the four attachments. It
liberates the mind, rendering it independent and incapable of becoming
bound, enslaved, overpowered by anything whatsoever, including God in
heaven, spirits, or celestial beings. No other religion is prepared to
let the individual free himself completely, or be entirely self reliant
We must be fully aware of this principle of self-reliance, which is a
key feature of Buddhism. As soon as we see that Buddhism has everything
that any other religion has and also several things that none of them
have, we realize that Buddhism is for everyone. Buddhism is the
universal religion. It can be put into practice by everyone, in every
age and era. People everywhere have the same problem: to free
themselves from suffering-suffering which is inherent in birth, aging,
pain and death, suffering which stems from desire, from grasping.
Everyone without exception, celestial being, human being, or beast, has
this same problem, and everyone has the same job to do, namely to
eliminate completely the desire, the unskillful grasping which is the
root cause of that suffering. Thus Buddhism is the universal religion.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Chapter 6: &nbsp;The Things We Cling To</a></p>

<p>What are we clinging to? What is our handhold? What we are
clinging to is the world itself. In Buddhism the word "world" has a
broader connotation than it has in ordinary usage. It refers to all
things, to the totality. It does not refer just to human beings, or
celestial beings, or gods, or beasts, or the denizens of hell, or
demons, or hungry ghosts, or titans, or any particular realm of
existence at all. What the word "world" refers to here is the whole lot
taken together. To know the world is difficult because certain levels
of the world are concealed. Most of us are familiar with only the
outermost layer or level, the level of relative truth, the level
corresponding to the intellect of the average man. For this reason
Buddhism teaches us about the world at various levels. The Buddha had a
method of instruction based on a division of the world into a material
or physical aspect and non-material or mental aspect. He further
divided up the mental world or mind into four parts. Counting the
physical and the mental together makes a total of five components,
called by the Buddha the Five Aggregates, which together go to make up
the world, in particular living creatures and man himself. In looking
at the world we shall concentrate on the world of living creatures, in
particular man, because it is man that happens to be the problem. In
man these five components are all present together: his physical body
is the material aggregate; his mental aspect is divisible into four
aggregates, which we shall now describe.</p>
<p>The first of the mental aggregates is feeling (vedana), which
is of three kinds, namely pleasure or gratification, displeasure or
suffering, and a neutral kind, which is neither pleasure nor
displeasure, but which is a kind of feeling nevertheless. Under normal
conditions feelings are always present in us. Every day we are filled
with feelings. The Buddha, then, pointed out feeling as one of the
components which together go to make up the man. The second component
of mind is perception (sanna). This is the process of becoming aware,
similar to waking up as opposed to being sound asleep or unconscious,
or dead. It refers to memory as well as awareness of sense impressions,
covering both the primary sensation resulting from contact with an
object by way of eye, ear, nose, tongue, or body, and the recall of
previous impressions. Thus one may be directly aware of an object as
black or white, long or short, man or beast, and so on, or one may be
similarly aware in retrospect by way of memory. The third mental
aggregate is the actively thinking component (sankhara) in an
individual-thinking of doing some thing, thinking of saying something,
good thought and bad thought, willed thinking, active thinking-this is
the third mental aggregate. The fourth component of mind is
consciousness (vinnana). It is the function of knowing the objects
perceived by way of eye, ear, nose, tongue and the general body sense,
and also by way of the mind itself. These five aggregates constitute
the site of the four kinds of clinging explained in the fourth chapter.
Turn back and read it again, and think it over so that you understand
it properly. You will then realize that it is these five aggregates
that are the object and handhold for our grasping and clinging. A
person may grasp at any one of these groups as being a self according
to the extent of his ignorance. For instance, a boy who carelessly
bumps into a door and hurts himself feels he has to give the door a
kick in order to relieve his anger and pain. In other words, he is
grasping at a purely material object, namely the door, which is nothing
but wood, as being a self. This is attachment at the lowest level of
all. A man who be comes angry with his body to the point of striking it
or hitting himself on the head is grasping and clinging in the same
way. He is taking those body parts to be selves. If he is rather more
intelligent than that, he may seize on feeling, or perception or active
thinking, or consciousness, at any one of these groups as being a self.
If he is unable to distinguish them individually, he may grasp at the
whole lot collectively as being a self, that is, take all five groups
together to be "his self." After the physical body, the group next most
likely to be clung to as being a self is feeling pleasurable, painful,
or neutral. Let us consider the situation in which we find ourselves,
entranced with sensual pleasures, in particular delectable sensations,
caught up heart and soul in the various colors and shapes, sound,
scents, tastes and tactile objects that we perceive. Here feeling is
the pleasure and delight experienced, and it is to that very feeling of
pleasure and delight that we cling. Almost everyone clings to feeling
as being a self, because there is no one who does not like delightful
sensations, especially tactile sensations by way of the skin. Ignorance
or delusion blinds a person to all else. He sees only the delightful
object and grasps at it as being a self; he regards that object as
"mine." Feeling, whether of pleasure or displeasure, is truly a site of
suffering. Spiritually speaking, these feelings of pleasure and
displeasure may be considered as synonymous with suffering, because
they give rise to nothing but mental torment. Pleasure renders the mind
buoyant; displeasure deflates it. Gain and loss, happiness and sorrow,
amount in effect to mental restlessness or instability; they set the
mind spinning. This is what is meant by grasping at feeling as being a
self. We should all do well to have a closer look at this process of
grasping at feeling as being a self, as being "ours," and try to gain a
proper understanding of it. Understanding feeling as an object of
clinging, the mind will be rendered independently of it. Feeling
normally has control over the mind, luring us into situations that we
regret later on. In his practical path to perfection or arahantship,
the Buddha teaches us repeatedly to give particular attention to the
examination of feeling. Many have become arahants and broken free from
suffering by means of restricting feeling to simply an object of study.</p>
<p>Feeling is more likely than any of the other aggregates to
serve as a handhold for us to cling to because feeling is the primary
objective of all our striving and activity. We study industriously and
work at our jobs in order to get money. Then we go and buy things:
utensils, food, amusements, things covering the whole range from
gastronomy to sex. And then we partake of these things with one single
objective, namely pleasurable feeling, in other words delightful
stimulation of eye, ear, nose, tongue and body. We invest all our
resources, monetary, physical, mental, simply in the expectation of
pleasurable feeling. And everyone knows well enough in his own mind
that if it weren't for the lure of pleasurable feeling, he would never
invest study, work and physical energy in the search for money. We can
see, then, that feeling is no small matter. A knowledge and
understanding of it puts us in a position to keep it under control,
makes us sufficiently high-minded to remain above feelings, and enables
us to carry out all our activities far better than we otherwise could.
In similar fashion even the problems that arise in a social group have
their origins in pleasurable feeling. And when we analyze closely the
clashes between nations, or between opposing blocs, we discover that
there too, both sides are just slaves to pleasurable feeling. A war is
not fought because of adherence to a doctrine or an ideal or anything
of the sort. In point of fact, the motivation is the anticipation of
pleasurable feeling. Each side sees itself making all sorts of gains,
scooping up benefits for itself. The doctrine is just camouflage, or at
best a purely secondary motive. The most deep- seated cause of all
strife is really subservience to pleasurable feeling. To know feeling
is, then, to know an important root cause responsible for our falling
slaves to the mental defilements, to evil, to suffering. If this is how
things are in the case of human beings, the celestial beings are no
better off. They are subservient to pleasurable feeling just as are
humans, and more so, though they may suppose it to be something better
and finer, more subject to free will than is the human variety. But
even they are not free from craving and attachment, from the
fascination of delectable sensations received by way of eye, ear, nose,
tongue, body and mind. Still higher up at the level of the gods,
sensual delights necessarily have been discarded completely; but even
this does not bring liberation from another kind of delight, the
pleasure associated with deep concentration practice. When the mind is
deeply concentrated, it experiences pleasure, a delightful sensation to
which it then becomes attached. Although this has nothing to do with
sensuality, it is pleasurable feeling nevertheless. Animals lower down
the scale than human beings are bound to fall under the power of
pleasurable feeling in much cruder ways than we do. To know the nature
of feeling, in particular to know that feeling is not a self at all and
not something to be clung to, is, then, of very great use in life.
Perception, too, can easily be seized on as being a self or "one's
self." The average villager likes to say that when we fall asleep,
something, which he calls the "soul," departs from the body. The body
is then like a log of wood, receiving no sensation by way of eye, ear,
nose, tongue or body. As soon as that something has returned to the
body, awareness and wakefulness are restored. A great many people have
this naive belief that perception is "the self." But, as the Buddha
taught, perception is not a self. Perception is simply sensation and
memory, that is, knowing, and is bound to be present as long as the
body continues to function normally. As soon as the bodily functions
become disrupted, that thing we call perception changes or ceases to
function. For this reason true Buddhists refuse to accept perception as
a self, though the average person does choose to accept it as such,
clinging to it as "myself." Close examination along Buddhist lines
reveals that quite the opposite is the case. Perception is nobody's
self at all; it is simply a result of natural processes and nothing
more.</p>
<p>The next possible point of attachment is active thinking,
intending to do this or that, intending to get this or that, mental
action good or bad. This is once again a manifestation of the arising
of strong ideas of selfhood. Everyone feels that if any thing at all is
to be identified as his self, then it is more likely to be this
thinking element than any other. For instance, one philosopher in
recent centuries had a naive philosophy on the basis of which he
proclaimed: "I think, therefore I am." Even philosophers in this
scientific age have the same ideas about "the self" as people have had
for thousands of years, maintaining that the thinking element is the
self. They regard as the self that which they understand to be "the
thinker." We have said that the Buddha denied that either feeling or
perception might be a self. He also rejected thinking, the thinking
aspect of the mind as a self, because the activity which manifests as
thought is a purely natural event. Thought arises as a result of the
interaction of a variety of prior events. It is just one of the
aggregation of assorted components that makes up "the individual," and
no "I" or "self" entity is involved. Hence we maintain that this
thinking component is devoid of selfhood, just as are the other
aggregates we have mentioned.</p>
<p>The difficulty in understanding this lies in our inadequate
knowledge of the mental element or mind. We are familiar only with the
body, the material element, and know almost nothing about the other,
the mental, nonmaterial element. As a result, we have difficulty
understanding it. Here it can only be said that the Buddha taught that
"the individual" is a combination of the five aggregates, physical and
mental. Now, when the event we call thinking takes place, we jump to
the conclusion that there is "someone" there who is "the thinker." We
believe there is a thinker, a soul, which is master of the body or
something of the sort. But the Buddha rejected such entities
completely. When we analyze "the individual" into these five
components, there is nothing left over, proving that he consists of
just these components and that there is nothing that might be "his
self." Not even thinking is a self as the average man commonly supposes.</p>
<p>Now the last group, consciousness (vinnana) is simply the
function of becoming fully aware of objects perceived by way of eye,
ear, nose, tongue and body. It is no self either. The organs simply
take in the color and shapes, sounds, odors, tastes and tactile objects
that impinge on them, and as a result consciousness of those objects
arises in three stages. In the case of the eye there arises clear
consciousness of the shape of the visual object, whether it is man or
beast, long or short, black or white. The arising of clear
consciousness in this way is a mechanical process which happens of its
own accord, automatically. There are some who maintain that this is the
"soul," the "spirit," which moves into and out of the mind and receives
stimuli by way of the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, and consider it
to be "the self." Buddhists recognize it as just nature. If a visual
object and an eye complete with optic nerve make contact, seeing will
take place and there will arise visual consciousness. And there is once
again no need for any self whatsoever. When we have analyzed the
"being" into its components, namely body, feeling, perception, thinking
and consciousness, we find no part which might be a self or belong to a
self. Thus we can completely reject the false self idea and conclude
that nobody is or has a self at all. When one ceases to cling to
things, no longer liking or disliking them, this indicates that one has
perceived that those things are not selves. Rational thinking is
sufficient to convince one that they cannot be selves; but the result
is only belief, not clear insight of the sort that can completely cut
out clinging to them as selves. For this very reason we have to study
and examine the five aggregates on the basis of the threefold training
and develop sufficient insight to be able to give up clinging to this
self idea. This practice with respect to the five aggregates serves to
develop clear insight and eliminate ignorance. When we have completely
eliminated ignorance, we shall be able to see for ourselves that none
of the aggregates is a self, none is worth clinging to. All clinging,
even the kind that has existed since birth, will then cease completely.
It is essential, then, that we study thoroughly the five aggregates,
which are the objects of the self conceit. The Buddha stressed this
aspect of his teaching more than any other. It may be summed up very
briefly by saying: "None of the five aggregates is a self." This should
be considered a key point in Buddhism, whether one looks at it as
philosophy, as science, or as religion. When we know this truth,
ignorance-based grasping and clinging vanish, desire of any sort has no
means of arising, and suffering ceases.</p>
<p>Why is it, then, that we normally don't see these five aggregates as
they really are? When we were born, we had no understanding of things.
We acquired knowledge on the basis of what people taught us. The way
they taught us led us to understand that all things are selves. The
power of the primal instinctive belief in selfhood, which is present
right from birth, becomes very strong in the course of time. In
speaking we use the words "I, you, he, she," which only serve to
consolidate the self idea. We say: "This is Mr. X; that is Mr. Y. He is
Mr. A's son and Mr. B's grandson. This is So - and - so's husband; that
is So - and - so's wife." This way of speaking serves simply to
identify people as selves. The result is that we are, none of us,
conscious of our clinging to selfhood, which increases daily. When we
cling to something as being a self, the result is selfishness, and our
actions are biased accordingly. If we were to develop sufficient
insight to see this idea as a deception, we would stop clinging to the
ideas of "Mr. A and Mr. B, high class and low class, beast and human
being," and would see that these are nothing more than terms which man
has devised for use in social intercourse. When we have come to
understand this, we can be said to have dispensed with one sort of
social deception. When we examine the whole of what goes to make up Mr.
A, we find that Mr. A is simply an aggregation of body, feeling,
perception, thinking and consciousness. This is a rather more
intelligent way of looking at things. Doing this, one is not deluded by
worldly relative truth. It is possible to carry the process of analysis
further than this. For instance the physical body can be divided up
rather crudely into the elements of earth, water, wind and fire; or it
can be analyzed scientifically into carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and so on.
The deeper we look, the less we are deceived. Penetrating below the
surface, we find that in fact there is no person; there are only
elements, physical and mental. Looked at in this light, the "person"
disappears. The idea of "Mr. A and Mr. B, high - class and low - class"
dissolves. The idea of "my child, my husband, my wife" vanishes away.
When we look at things in the light of absolute truth, we find only
elements: earth, water, wind and fire; oxygen, hydrogen and so on;
body, feeling, perception, thinking and consciousness. On examining
these closely we find they all have one property in common, namely
emptiness. Each is empty of what we refer to as "its self." Earth,
water, wind and fire, looked at properly, are seen to be empty of
selfhood. It is possible for each one of us to see anything and
everything as empty in this sense. This done, grasping and clinging
will have no means of arising and any already arisen will have no means
of remaining. They will dissolve, pass away, vanish entirely, not a
trace remaining. So there are no animals, no people, no elements, no
aggregates. There are no things at all; there is only emptiness,
emptiness of selfhood. When we don't grasp and cling, there is no way
suffering can arise. One who sees all things as empty is quite unmoved
when people call him good or bad, happy or miserable, or anything. This
is the fruit of knowledge, understanding, and clear insight into the
true nature of the five aggregates which makes it possible to give up
completely those four kinds of unskillful clinging. In summary,
everything in the whole world is included within the five aggregates,
namely matter, feeling, perception, thinking and consciousness. Each of
these groups is a deception, each is quite devoid of selfhood, but has
the seductive power to induce grasping and clinging. As a result, the
ordinary person desires to possess, desires to be, desires not to
possess, desires not to be, all of which only serves to produce
suffering, suffering which is not obvious, but concealed. It behooves
every one to utilize the threefold training in morality, concentration
and insight, and eliminate delusion with respect to the five aggregates
completely and utterly. A person who has done this will not fall under
the power of the five aggregates and will be free of suffering. For him
life will be unblemished bliss. His mind will be above all things for
as long as he lives. This is the fruit of clear and perfect insight
into the five aggregates.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Chapter 7: &nbsp;Inslght, By The Nature Method</a></p>

<p>In this chapter we shall see how concentration may come about
naturally on the one hand, and as a result of organized practice on the
other. The end result is identical in the two cases: the mind is
concentrated and fit to be used for carrying out close introspection.
One thing must be noticed, however: the intensity of concentration that
comes about naturally is usually sufficient and appropriate for
introspection and insight, whereas the concentration resulting from
organized training is usually excessive, more than can be made use of.
Furthermore, misguided satisfaction with that highly developed
concentration may result. While the mind is fully concentrated, it is
likely to be experiencing such a satisfying kind of bliss and well-
being that the meditator may become attached to it, or imagine it to be
the Fruit of the Path. Naturally occurring concentration, which is
sufficient and suitable for use in introspection, is harmless, having
none of the disadvantages inherent in concentration developed by means
of intensive training. In the Tipitaka, there are numerous references
to people attaining naturally all states of Path and Fruit. This
generally came about in the presence of the Buddha himself but also
happened later with other teachers. These people did not go into the
forest and sit, assiduously practicing concentration on certain objects
in the way described in later manuals. Clearly no organized effort was
involved when arahantship was attained by the first five disciples of
the Buddha on hearing the Discourse on Non - selfhood, or by the one
thousand hermits on hearing the Fire Sermon. In these cases, keen,
penetrating insight came about quite naturally. These examples clearly
show that natural concentration is liable to develop of its own accord
while one is attempting to understand clearly some question, and that
the resulting insight, as long as it is firmly established must be
quite intense and stable. It happens naturally, automatically in just
the same way as the mind becomes concentrated the moment we set about
doing arithmetic. Likewise in firing a gun, when we take aim, the mind
automatically becomes concentrated and steady. This is how naturally
occurring concentration comes about. We normally overlook it completely
because it does not appear the least bit magical, miraculous, or awe
inspiring. But through the power of just this naturally occurring
concentration, most of us could actually attain liberation. We could
attain the Fruit of the Path, Nirvana, arahantship, just by means of
natural concentration. So don't overlook this naturally occurring
concentration. It is something most of us either already have, or can
readily develop. We have to do everything we can to cultivate and
develop it, to make it function perfectly and yield the appropriate
results, just as did most of the people who succeeded in becoming
arahants, none of whom knew anything of modern concentration techniques.</p>
<p>Now let us have a look at the nature of the states of inner
awareness leading up to full insight into "the world," that is, into
the five aggregates. The first stage is joy (piti), mental happiness or
spiritual well being. Doing good in some way, even giving alms,
considered the most basic form of merit-making, can be a source of joy.
Higher up, at the level of morality, completely blameless conduct by
way of word and action brings an increase in joy. Then in the case of
concentration, we discover that there is a definite kind of delight
associated with the lower stages of concentration. This rapture has in
itself the power to induce tranquillity. Normally the mind is quite
unrestrained, continually falling slave to all sorts of thoughts and
feelings associated with enticing things outside. It is normally
restless, not calm. But as spiritual joy becomes established, calm and
steadiness are bound to increase in proportion. When steadiness has
been perfected, the result is full concentration. The mind becomes
tranquil, steady, flexible, manageable, light and at ease, ready to be
used for any desired purpose, in particular for the elimination of the
defilements. It is not a case of the mind's being rendered silent, hard
and rocklike. Nothing like that happens at all. The body feels normal,
but the mind is especially calm and suitable for use in thinking and
introspection. It is perfectly clear, perfectly cool, perfectly still
and restrained. In other words, it is fit for work, ready to know. This
is the degree of concentration to be aimed for, not the very deep
concentration where one sits rigidly like a stone image, quite devoid
of awareness. Sitting in deep concentration like that, one is in no
position to investigate anything. A deeply concentrated mind cannot
practice introspection at all. It is in a state of unawareness and is
of no use for insight. DEEP CONCENTRATION IS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO
INSIGHT PRACTICE. To practice introspection one must first return to
the shallower levels of concentration; then one can make use of the
power the mind has acquired. Highly developed concentration is just a
tool. In this developing of insight by the nature method, we don't have
to attain deep concentration and sit with the body rigid. Rather, we
aim at a calm, steady mind, one so fit for work that when it is applied
to insight practice, it gains right understanding with regard to the
entire world. Insight so developed is natural insight, the same sort as
was gained by some individuals while sitting listening to the Buddha
expounding Dhamma. It is conducive to thought and introspection of the
right kind, the kind that brings understanding. And it involves neither
ceremonial procedures nor miracles. This doesn't mean, however, that
insight will arise instantaneously. One can't be an arahant straight
off. The first step in knowledge may come about at any time, depending
once again on the intensity of the concentration. It may happen that
what arises is not true insight, because one has been practicing
wrongly or has been surrounded by too many false views. But however it
turns out, the insight that does arise is bound to be something quite
special, for instance extraordinarily clear and profound. If the
knowledge gained is right knowledge, corresponding with reality,
corresponding with Dhamma, then it will progress, developing ultimately
into right and true knowledge of all phenomena. If insight develops in
only small measure, it may convert a person into an Aryian at the
lowest stage; or if it is not sufficient to do that, it will just make
him a high- minded individual, an ordinary person of good qualities. If
the environment is suitable and good qualities have been properly and
adequately established, it is possible to become an arahant. It all
depends on the circumstances. But however far things go, as long as the
mind has natural concentration, this factor called insight is bound to
arise and to correspond more or less closely with reality. Because we,
being Buddhists, have heard about, thought about and studied the world,
the five aggregates and phenomena, in the hope of coming to under stand
their true nature, it follows that the knowledge we acquire while in a
calm and concentrated state will not be in any way misleading. It is
bound to be always beneficial. The expression "insight into the true
nature of things" refers to seeing transience, unsatisfactoriness and
non-selfhood, seeing that nothing is worth getting, nothing is worth
being, seeing that no object whatsoever should be grasped at and clung
to as being a self or as belonging to a self, as being good or bad,
attractive or repulsive. Liking or disliking anything, even if it is
only an idea or a memory, is clinging. To say that nothing is worth
getting or being is the same as to say that nothing is worth clinging
to. "Getting" refers to setting one's heart on property, position,
wealth, or any pleasing object. "Being" refers to the awareness of
one's status as husband, wife, rich man, poor man, winner, loser, or
human being, or even the awareness of being oneself. If we really look
deeply at it, even being oneself is no fun, is wearisome, because it is
a source of suffering. If one can completely give up clinging to the
idea of being oneself, then being oneself will no longer be suffering.
This is what it is to see the worthlessness of being anything, and is
the gist of the statement that being anything, no matter what, is bound
to be suffering in a way appropriate to that particular state of being.
Any state of being, if it is to continue as such, has to be made to
last, to endure. At the very least, it must endure in one's mind in the
form of a belief in that particular state of being. When there exists
"oneself," there are bound to exist things which are other than that
self and belong to it. Thus one has one's children, one's wife, one's
this, that and the other. Then one has one's duty as husband or wife,
master or servant, and so on. All this points to the truth of the
statement that there is no state of being such that to maintain it will
not involve struggle. The trouble and struggle necessary to maintain
one's state of being are simply the result of blind infatuation with
things, of clinging to things. If we were to give up trying to get or
to be anything, how could we continue to exist? This is bound to be a
major source of skepticism for anyone who has not given much thought to
the matter. The words "getting" and "being" as used here refer to
getting and being based on mental defilements, on craving, on the idea
of "worth getting, worth being," so that the mind does get and be in
real earnest. This is bound to lead to depression, anxiety, distress
and upset, or at least a heavy burden on the mind, right from beginning
to end. Knowing this truth, we shall be constantly on the alert,
keeping watch over the mind to see that it doesn't fall slave to
getting and being through the influence of grasping and clinging. Aware
that in reality things are just not worth getting or being, we shall be
smart enough to stay aloof from them.</p>
<p>If, however, we are not yet in a position to withdraw
completely from having and being, we must be mindful and wide awake, so
that when we do get or become something, we do so without emotional
upset. We must not be like those people who, turning a blind eye and a
deaf ear, go ahead brainlessly and inexpertly getting or becoming, with
the result that they fall right into the pit of their own stupidity and
attachment, and end up having to commit suicide. The world and all
things have the property of impermanence, of worthlessness and of not
belonging to anyone. Any individual who grasps at and clings to
anything will be hurt by it, in the very beginning when he first
desires to get it or to be it, later while he is in the process of
getting it and being it, and then again after he has got it or been it.
All the time, before, during and after, when anyone grasps and clings
with deaf ear and blind eye, he will receive his full measure of
suffering, just as can be seen happening to all deluded worldlings. It
is the same even with goodness, which everyone values highly. If anyone
becomes involved with goodness in the wrong way and clings to it too
much, he will derive just as much suffering from goodness as he would
from evil. In becoming involved with goodness, we have to bear in mind
that it possesses this property. A skeptic may ask: "If nothing at all
is worth getting or being, does it follow that nobody ought to do any
work or build up wealth, position and property?" Anyone who comprehends
this subject can see that a person equipped with right knowledge and
understanding is actually in a far better position to carry out any
task than one who is subject to strong desires, foolish, and lacking in
understanding. Very briefly, in becoming involved in things, we must do
so mindfully; our actions must not be motivated by craving. The result
will follow accordingly. The Buddha and all the other arahants were
completely free of desire, yet succeeded in doing many things far more
useful than what any of us are capable of. If we look at accounts of
how the Buddha spent his day, we find that he slept for only four hours
and spent all the rest of the time working. We spend more than four
hours a day just amusing ourselves. If the defilements responsible for
the desire to be and get things had been completely eliminated, what
was the force that motivated the Buddha and all Arahants to do all
this? They were motivated by discrimination coupled with goodwill
(metta). Even actions based on natural bodily wants such as receiving
and eating alms food were motivated by discrimination They were free of
defilements, free of all desire to keep on living in order to be this
or to get that, but they did have the ability to discriminate between
what was worthwhile and what was not as the motivating force that sent
their bodies out to find food. If they found food, well and good; if
not, never mind. When they were suffering with fever, they knew how to
treat it and did so as well as possible on the basis of this knowledge.
If the fever was quite overpowering and they were not strong, they
recalled that to die is natural. Whether they lived or died was of no
significance to them; they were of equal value in their eyes If one is
to be completely free of suffering, this is the very best attitude to
have. There need not be any self as master of the body. Discrimination
alone enables the body to carry on by its natural power. The example of
the Buddha shows that the power of pure discrimination and pure
goodwill alone is sufficient to keep an arahant living in the world,
and, what is more, doing far more good for others than people still
subject to craving. Defiled people are likely to do only what benefits
themselves since they act out of selfishness. By contrast, the deeds of
arahants are entirely selfless and so are perfectly pure. In desiring
to get and be, one is acting quite inappropriately, one is mistaking
evil for good, not knowing what is what. Let us all, then, go about
things intelligently, always bearing in mind that, in reality, nothing
is worth getting or being, nothing is worth becoming infatuated with,
nothing is worth clinging to. Let us act in a manner in keeping with
the knowledge that things are by their very nature not worth getting or
being. If we do have to become involved in things, then let us go about
it the right way, acting appropriately. This is the way to keep the
mind always pure, unobscured, tranquil and cool. It allows us to become
involved in the world, in things, without doing ourselves any harm in
the process. When the ordinary worldly man hears that nothing is worth
getting or being, he is not convinced, he doesn't believe it. But
anyone who understands the real meaning of this statement becomes
emboldened and cheered by it. His mind becomes master of things and
independent of them. He becomes capable of going after things sure in
the knowledge that he will not become enslaved by them. His actions are
not motivated by desire and he is not so blind with passion that he
comes to be a slave to things. In getting anything or being anything,
let us always be aware that we are getting or being something which, in
terms of absolute truth, we cannot get or be at all, because there is
nothing that we can really get or be as we might wish. All things are
transient and unsatisfactory and can never belong to us; and yet we go
foolishly ahead, grasping at them and craving for them. In other words,
we act inappropriately, or in a way which does not accord with the true
nature of things, simply because we become involved in them while
ignorant of their true nature. The result is bound to be all manner of
suffering and trouble. The reason a person is incapable of doing his
job perfectly, faultlessly, is that he is always far too concerned with
getting something and being something, always motivated entirely by his
own desires. As a result, he is not master of himself and cannot be
consistently good, honest and fair. In every case of failure and ruin,
the root cause is slavery to desire. To come to know the true nature of
things is the true objective of every Buddhist. It is the means by
which we can liberate ourselves. Regardless of whether we are hoping
for worldly benefits, such as wealth, position and fame; or for
benefits in the next world, such as heaven; or for the supra-mundane
benefit, the Fruit of the Path, Nirvana--whatever we are hoping for,
the only way to achieve it is by means of this right knowledge and
insight. We thrive on insight. In the Texts it is said that we may
become purified through insight and not by any other means. Our path to
freedom lies in having the insight, the clear vision, that in all
things there neither is nor has ever been anything at all that is worth
grasping at or clinging to, worth getting or being, worth risking life
and limb for. We have things and are things only in terms of worldly,
relative truth. In worldly language, we say we are this or that, just
because in any society it is expedient to recognize by names and
occupations. But we mustn't go believing that we really are this or
that, as is assumed at the level of relative truth. To do so is to
behave like the crickets, which, when their faces become covered with
dirt, become disoriented and muddled, and proceed to bite each other
until they die. We humans, when our faces become covered in dirt, when
we are subject to all sorts of delusions, become so bewildered and
disoriented that we do things no human being could ever do under
ordinary circumstances--killing for instance. So let us not go blindly
clinging to relative truths; rather let us be aware that they are just
relative truths, essential in a society but nothing more. We have to be
aware of what this body and mind really is, what its true nature is. In
particular, we have to be aware of its impermanence,
unsatisfactoriness, and non-selfhood, and make sure we always remain
independent of it.</p>
<p>As for the wealth, position and so on, which we can't do
without, let us regard these too as relative truths so that we can
break free from the existing custom of saying, for instance: "This
belongs to So - and - so. That belongs to Such and - such." The law
watches over ownership rights for us; there is no need for us to cling
to the idea of "mine." We ought to possess things purely and simply for
the sake of convenience and ease, and not so that they can be master
over our minds. When we have this clear knowledge, things will become
our servants and slaves and we shall remain on top of them. If our
thoughts go the way of craving and attachment, so that we become
conscious of having such - and - such and being so - and - so, clinging
firmly to these ideas, things will get on top of us, and we shall be
the servants and slaves, under their control instead. The tables can
quite easily be turned in this way, so we have to be careful. We have
to arrange things in such a way that we are sure of staying independent
and on top of things. If we don't, we may find ourselves in a most
pitiable position and feel very sorry for ourselves indeed. When we
have really come to perceive clearly that nothing is worth getting or
being, disenchantment (nibbida) develops in proportion to the intensity
of the insight. It is a sign that the clinging has become less firm and
is starting to give way. It is a sign that we have been slaves for so
long that the idea of trying to escape has at last occurred to us. This
is the onset of disenchantment and disillusionment, when one becomes
fed up with one's own stupidity in grasping at and clinging to things,
believing things to be worth having and being. As soon as
disenchantment has set in, there is bound to come about a natural,
automatic process of disentanglement (vimutti), as if a rope with which
one had been tightly bound were being untied; or a rinsing out, as when
the dye that had been firmly fixed in a piece of cloth is washed out by
soaking it in the appropriate substances. This process whereby clinging
gives way to a breaking free from, or a dissolving out from the world,
or from the objects of that clinging, was called by the Buddha,
emancipation (vimutti). This state is most important. Though not the
final stage, it is a most important step towards complete liberation.
When one has broken free to this extent, complete liberation from
suffering is assured. Once broken free from slavery, one need never
again be a slave to the world. One becomes pure and uncontaminated
whereas previously one was defiled in every way. To be enslaved to
things is to be defiled in body, speech and thought. To break free from
slavery to the delightful tastes of the world is to achieve the pure
condition and never be defiled again. This real purity (Visuddhi), once
it has been attained, will give rise to a genuine calm and coolness
free from all turbulence, strife and torment. This state of freedom
from oppression and turbulence was called by the Buddha simply peace
(Santi), that is, stillness, coolness in all situations, which is
virtually the same thing as Nirvana. "Nirvana" has been translated as
"absence of any instrument of torture." Taken another way, it means
"extinction without remainder." So the word "Nirvana" has two very
important meanings; firstly, absence of any source of torment and
burning, freedom from all forms of bondage and constraint and secondly,
extinction, with no fuel for the further arising of suffering. The
combination of these meanings indicates a condition of complete freedom
from suffering. There are several other useful meanings for the word
"Nirvana." It can be taken to mean the extinction of suffering, or the
complete elimination of defilements, or the state, realm, or condition
that is the cessation of all suffering, all defilements and all karmic
activity. Though the word "Nirvana" is used by numerous different
sects, the sense in which they use it is often not the same at all. For
instance, one group takes it to mean simply calm and coolness, because
they identify Nirvana with deep concentration. Other groups even
consider total absorption in sensuality as Nirvana.</p>
<p>The Buddha defined Nirvana as simply that condition of freedom
from bondage, torment and suffering which results from seeing the true
nature of the worldly condition and all things, and so being able to
give up all clinging to them. It is essential, then, that we recognize
the very great value of insight into the true nature of things and
endeavor to cultivate this insight by one means or another. Using one
method, we simply encourage it to come about of its own accord,
naturally, by developing, day and night, the joy that results from
mental purity, until the qualities we have described gradually come
about. The other method consists in developing mental power by
following an organized system of concentration and insight practice.
This latter technique is appropriate for people with a certain kind of
disposition, who may make rapid progress with it if conditions are
right. But we can practice the development of insight by the nature
method in all circumstances and at all times just by making our own way
of daily living so pure and honest that there arise in succession
spiritual joy (piti and pamoda), calm (passaddhi), insight into the
true nature of things (yathabhutananadassana), disenchantment
(nibbida), withdrawal (viraga), escape (vimutti), purification from
defilements (visuddhi), and coolness (santi), so that we come to get a
taste of freedom from suffering (nibbana)- steadily, naturally, day by
day, month by month, year by year, gradually approaching closer and
closer to Nirvana. Summing up, natural concentration and insight, which
enable a person to attain the Path and the Fruit, consist in verifying
all day and every day the truth of the statement that nothing is worth
getting or being. Anyone who wishes to get this result must strive to
purify himself and to develop exemplary personal qualities, so that he
can find perpetual spiritual joy in work and leisure. That very joy
induces clarity and freshness, mental calm and stillness, and serves,
naturally and automatically, to give the mind ability to think and
introspect. With the insight that nothing is worth getting or being
constantly present, the mind loses all desire for the things it once
used to grasp at and cling to. It is able to break free from the things
it used to regard as "me and mine," and all blind craving for things
ceases. Suffering, which no longer has anywhere to lodge, dwindles
right away, and the job of eliminating suffering is done. This is the
reward, and it can be gained by anyone of us.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Chapter 8: &nbsp;Insight, By Organized Training</a>


</p>

<p>Now we shall deal with the organized systems of insight
training, which were not taught by the Buddha but were developed by
later teachers. This kind of practice is suitable for people at a
fairly undeveloped stage, who still cannot perceive the
unsatisfactoriness of worldly existence with their own eyes, naturally.
This doesn't mean, however, that the results obtained by these systems
have any special qualities not obtainable by the nature method, because
when we examine the Tipitaka closely, we find the nature method is the
only one mentioned. Some people consider, however, that natural insight
can be developed only by someone who has become so remarkably virtuous,
or has such a suitable disposition, that for him to come to a full
understanding of things is just child's play. What is a person to do
who lacks transcendent virtues and the appropriate disposition? For
such people, teachers laid down ordered systems of practice, concise
courses which start from scratch and have to be followed through
thoroughly and systematically. These systems of practice for developing
insight are now known by the technical term "Vipassana - dhura."
Vipassana - dhura is contrasted with Study (Gantha - dhura), the two
being considered nowadays complementary aspects of training. Vipassana-
dhura is study done within; it is strictly mental training, having
nothing to do with textbooks. Neither the term Study (Gantha - dhura)
nor Vipassana - dhura is mentioned in the Tipitaka, both appearing only
in later books; but Vipassana - dhura is nevertheless a genuine
Buddhist practice, designed for people intent on eliminating suffering.
It is based directly on sustained, concentrated introspection. In order
to explain Vipassana to people, teachers in former ages considered it
in terms of the following questions: What is the basis, the foundation
of Vipassana? What are the characteristics by which we may know that
this is Vipassana? Just what is the activity called Vipassana? What
should be the ultimate result of Vipassana? Asked what is the basis,
the foundation of Vipassana, we answer: morality and concentration.
"Vipassana" means "clear insight," and refers to the unobscured vision
that may arise when a person's mind is full of joy and devoid of any
defilement. Joy develops when there is Moral Purity (Sila visuddhi);
morality is a prerequisite. This is stated in the texts
(Rathavinitasutta, Majjhima - nikaya, 24), where the practice is
described as proceeding in a series of stages called the Seven
Purifications, and culminating in the Path and the Fruit. Teachers
regard the attainment of Moral Purity as the first of the Seven
Purifications. It consists of faultless behavior and is prerequisite to
purification of the mind (Citta - visuddhi). Purification of the mind,
achieved when the mind has been rendered free of any contamination, is
conducive to Purification of Views (Ditthi- visuddhi) or freedom from
misunderstanding. Freedom from misunderstanding leads to purity by
freedom from doubt (Kankhavitarana- visuddhi), and this conduces in its
turn to the arising of purity by knowledge and vision of what is the
true path to be followed and what is not the path (Magga - magga -
Nanadassana - visuddhi). This knowledge of the path to be followed
leads to the purity by knowledge and vision of the progress along the
path Patipada - Nanadassana visuddhi). This finally leads to the last
stage of full intuitive insight or purity of knowledge and vision
(Nanadassana - visuddhi), which is the perfection of the very Noble
Path. Because the Fruit of the Path arises automatically once the Path
is established, the attainment of the Path is regarded as the
culmination of the practice. Moral purity is faultless behavior by way
of body and speech. As long as any imperfection in body or speech
remains, morality in the true sense is lacking. When it has been
perfected, that is, when tranquillity of bodily activities and speech
has been achieved, the result is bound to be mental tranquillity,
conducive in its turn to the further stages of purification: freedom
from misunderstanding, freedom from doubt, knowledge as to what is the
Path to be followed and what is not, knowledge and vision of the
progress along the Path and finally full intuitive insight. These last
five stages constitute vipassana proper. Purification of conduct and
mind are merely the entrance into the path of vipassana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE SEVEN PURIFICATIONS, THE FIVE STAGES IN VIPASSANA, AND THE NINE STEPS IN THE PERFECTION OF KNOWLEDGE:</p>
<p>I Moral purity&nbsp;</p>
<p>II Mental purity&nbsp;</p>
<p>III (1) Freedom from false views&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV (2) Freedom from doubt&nbsp;</p>
<p>V (3) Knowledge and vision of what is the true Path&nbsp;</p>
<p>VI (4) Knowledge and vision of the progress along the Path (a)
Knowledge of arising and passing away (b) Knowledge of passing away (c)
Awareness of fearsomeness (d) Awareness of danger (e) Disenchantment
(f) Desire for freedom (g) Struggle to escape (h) Imperturbability (i)
Readiness to perceive the Four Noble Truths&nbsp;</p>
<p>VII (5) Full Intuitive Insight&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Purification consisting of freedom from misunderstanding
implies the elimination of all false views, both inborn and acquired.
It covers the whole range from irrational belief in magic to false
ideas as to the true nature of things-for instance, regarding this body
and mind as something enduring, something worthwhile, a self; seeing it
as animal, human being, celestial being, or god, or as something
magical or sacred; failing to perceive that it consists of just the
four elements, or of just body plus mind, and regarding it instead as a
self, as possessing a soul or spirit, which enters and leaves it;
failing to see it as consisting of the five aggregates: body, feeling,
perception, active thinking and consciousness; failing to see it as
just a mass of perceptions received by way of the eye, ear, nose,
tongue, body and mind. False views lead to belief in magic and sacred
objects, and so give rise to fear. Rites and rituals are then performed
to neutralize the fear, and the end result is firm attachment to rites
and rituals-all on account of false views. Such a situation indicates
views that are not as yet faultless. To have given up false views is to
have attained what was originally called the third Purification, and
what later teachers classed the first stage in vipassana. The
Purification consisting of freedom from doubt is brought about by
introspection into causes. With freedom from false views, one sees
oneself as just body plus mind. Freedom from doubt consists in
perceiving the nature of the causes responsible for the coming into
existence of the body-mind complex. One sees penetratingly and in fine
detail the coming into existence and the interaction of ignorance,
desire, grasping and clinging karma, "nutriment," and so on, to form
body and mind. Freedom from doubt results simply from this clear
knowledge of the causes and effects of all things. In the vipassana
system, teachers recognize twenty or thirty kinds of doubt, but summed
up they all amount to doubt as to whether or not "one's self" exists,
whether or not "one's self" existed previously, whether or not "one's
self" will continue to exist in the future and, if so, in what form.
The only way doubt can be completely dispelled is to realize that there
is no "I," but only elements, aggregates, a nervous system together
with such causes as ignorance, craving and attachment, karma,
"nutriment," and so on. Because no real "I" is involved at all, one
starts giving up the foolish idea: "I am, I have been, I shall be."
With the complete eradication of doubt, the second stage in vipassana
has been achieved. This does not mean that the "I"- conceit has been
given up for good and all; fine vestiges are still present. Adequate
understanding of the mode of interaction of causes has resulted in the
dispelling of doubt and has made it possible to give up the idea of "I"
in its grossest forms.</p>
<p>When doubt has been transcended, it becomes possible to bring
about the Purification consisting of perfect knowledge as to what is
the right path to follow and what is not. There exist several obstacles
to this further progress, which usually arise in the course of
vipassana practice. While the mind is in a concentrated state, there
are likely to arise various strange phenomena with which the meditator
may become overawed, such as wonderful impressive auras seen in the
mind's eye (the physical eyes being shut). If these effects are
purposely encouraged, they can become highly developed; and if the
meditator jumps to the conclusion that "this is the Fruit of vipassana
practice," or congratulates himself saying, "This is something
supernatural; this will do me!" and the like, the arising of these
phenomena is liable to bar the way to the true Path and Fruit.
Consequently, teachers consider it a side track, a blind alley. Another
example is the arising of feelings of joy and contentment which
continually overflow the mind to such an extent that it becomes
incapable of any further introspection, or jumps to the conclusion that
"this is Nirvana, right here and now," so that the way becomes blocked
and further progress is impossible. This is another obstruction to
insight. Teachers say, furthermore, that even insight into the nature
of body and mind may sometimes lead to self satisfaction and the
delusion that the meditator has a remarkable degree of spiritual
insight, so that he becomes overconfident. This too is an obstacle to
progress in vipassana. Occasionally the meditator may make use of the
mental power he has developed to make his body go rigid, with the
result that he loses the awareness necessary for further introspection.
This is a stubborn obstacle in the path to further progress, yet
meditators usually approve of it, regarding it as a supernatural
faculty, or even as the Fruit of the Path. Anyone who becomes so
pleased with and infatuated by the attainment of deep concentration,
this sitting with body rigid and devoid of all sensation, that he is
unable to progress further in vipassana, is in a most pitiable
position. Another condition that may very easily come about is a
blissful rapture the like of which the meditator has never encountered
before. Once arisen it induces wonder and amazement and unjustified
self satisfaction. While the rapture lasts, he body and the mind
experience extreme bliss and all problems vanish. Things that formerly
were liked or disliked are liked or disliked no longer when recalled to
mind. Things the meditator had formerly feared and dreaded or worried
and fretted over no longer induce those reactions, so that he gets the
false idea that he has already attained liberation, freedom from all
defilements; because for as long as he is in that condition he has all
the characteristics of a genuinely perfected individual. Should
satisfaction arise with respect to this condition, it acts as an
obstacle to further progress in vipassana. And in time the condition
will fade away so that things formerly liked or disliked will be liked
or disliked again just as before, or even more so. Yet another kind of
obstacle involves faith. Faith or confidence never felt before becomes
firmly established, for example confidence in the Threefold Gem,
Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, or in theories the meditator thinks out for
himself. There may even come about a most intense satisfaction in
Dhamma. The ability to remain unmoved by anything becomes so strongly
developed that it may even delude the meditator into believing he has
already attained the Fruit of the Path and Nirvana itself. These things
are a great difficulty for anyone encountering them for the first time.
As you can see they constitute a barrier in the way of vipassana. The
meditator, however, is likely to regard them as highly desirable until
such time as he develops the unobscured knowledge that these things are
in fact obstacles and succeeds in cutting out these finer defilements
completely. This knowledge of what is the right path and what is not
constitutes the third stage in vipassana and the fifth Purification.</p>
<p>Until such time as the aspirant has developed this knowledge
of what really constitutes the right path, he has to be always steering
himself away from the various side tracks. Once this knowledge of the
path to be followed has become fully established, however, any further
knowledge will automatically develop along the right line. It will
progress step by step, bringing perfectly clear understanding of the
true nature of things and ultimately perfect freedom from, and
non-involvement in things. The mind, equipped with this right
understanding, is all set to attain insight into the Four Noble Truths,
and is said to have attained the Purity by Knowledge and Vision of the
progress along the Path. This is counted as the fourth stage in
vipassana and the sixth Purification. The Tipitaka contains no detailed
explanation of the stages in this Knowledge and Vision of the progress
along the Path, but later teachers recognized in it nine steps, as
follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Vipassana has progressed properly, and the birth, aging,
pain and death of phenomena have been thoroughly scrutinized. The
arising and passing away of phenomena has been perceived in all
clarity. All phenomenal existence is seen to consist of just an endless
process of arising and ceasing like the glittering dazzle on the
surface of the sea, or like the forming and bursting of the foamy
crests of waves. This is known as knowledge of arising and passing away
(Udayabbayanupassana - nana). It is brought about by concentrated
introspection so clear, and sustained for so long a time that the
knowledge becomes firmly established, like a dye absorbed by the mind,
powerful enough to make the meditator become disenchanted with things
and give up clinging to them. This is the first step in the Knowledge
and Vision of the Progress along the Path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Arising and passing away, if observed simultaneously,
cannot be perceived with such clarity as they can if either one is
concentrated on separately. At this stage, the meditator gives up
watching one of the two, namely arising, and concentrates exclusively
on the passing away. This permits him to see the process of
disintegration and decay in such depth and intensity that he comes to
realize that decay and perishing are universally evident no matter
where in the world one looks. A mind dwelling in this knowledge is said
to be equipped with knowledge of decay and dissolution (Bhanganupassana
- nana). This is the second step in the developing of knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Knowledge of decay and dissolution, when sufficiently well
developed, gives rise next to the awareness that all things are to be
feared. All phenomenal existence, whether in the sensual realm, in the
form realm, or in the formless realm, is seen as inherently fearsome.
All spheres of existence are seen as thoroughly fearsome because the
decay and dissolution of all phenomena is perceived in every conscious
moment. Thus an intense apprehension arises in the mind of one
possessing this awareness and becomes established as a genuine fear.
This awareness sees nothing but fearsomeness, like poison, or deadly
weapons, or vicious armed bandits, completely filling the three spheres
of phenomenal existence-nothing but fearsomeness. This awareness of the
fearsomeness (Bhayatupatthana-nana) of all phenomenal existence is
reckoned as the third step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) When awareness of the completely fearsome nature of all
phenomenal existence has been fully developed, there will arise in its
turn awareness that all things are inherently dangerous. To become
involved in things is not safe. They are like a forest full of
dangerous beasts, and anyone seeking diversion in the forest finds
nothing pleasing there. This awareness of the danger (Adinavan-
upassana - nana) inherent in all phenomenal existence is the fourth
step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>e) When all things are seen to be in every way full of danger
this gives rise to disenchantment. Things are seen as resembling a
burntout house of which nothing remains but ashes and a skeleton,
utterly unattractive. This disenchantment (Nibbidanupassanaa - nana)
with having to be associated with conditioned things is the fifth step
in the developing of knowledge.</p>
<p>f) When genuine disenchantment has become established, there
arises a desire to become really free from those things. This is quite
unlike our ordinary desire for freedom, which, lacking the power of
concentration or insight to boost it up, is not real desire for
freedom. The disenchantment arising out of vipassana insight involves
the entire mind; and the desire for freedom is as great as the
disenchantment, so is very real and genuine. This desire to escape from
the unsatisfactoriness of phenomenal existence is as great as the
desire for freedom a frog struggling to escape from a snake's jaws, or
the desire for freedom of a deer or bird struggling to break loose from
a snare. This real desire to escape (Muncitukamyata - nana) from
unsatisfactoriness is the sixth step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>g) Now with the full development of the desire to escape,
there arises a feeling of an intense struggling to find a way out, an
ever-present feeling that, phenomenal existence being as it is, one has
to escape from it. Introspecting, one perceives the clinging and one
perceives the defilements that are the cause of the mind's bondage, the
fetters binding it securely to that condition. Consequently one seeks
for ways of weakening the defilements. Then seeing the defilements
weakened, one sets about destroying them completely. This weakening of
the defilements is illustrated by means of a simile. A man goes to his
fish trap and pulls out a snake thinking it to be a fish. When told it
is a snake, he doesn't believe it, at least not until he meets a wise,
benevolent and sympathetic teacher, who guides and instructs him so
that he comes to realize that it is in fact a snake. He then becomes
afraid and searches about for a means of killing it. He grabs the snake
by the neck and, lifting it above his head, swings it in a circle until
it is worn out and falls down dead. This simile illustrates the arising
of the knowledge that the defilements are the cause of people's bondage
to a condition much to be feared and dreaded. If one has no technique
for reducing the force of the defilements day by day, eradicating them
is bound to be impossible. The power of the defilements far exceeds
that of the still meager knowledge to be used in destroying them; hence
knowledge must be developed and increased, and the suffering produced
by the defilements will simultaneously diminish. Always maintaining and
developing the knowledge that all things are transient, worthless and
devoid of selfhood, that they are not worth getting or being, serves to
cut off the food supply to the defilements, weakening them day by day.
It behooves us to build ourselves up, develop, become more skillful and
ingenious. By this means, we can conquer defilements the size of
mountains, small though we may be. Our situation can be compared to
that of a small mouse faced with the job of killing several tigers. We
have to be really steadfast and always on the lookout for means
appropriate to a small mouse. If we get nowhere, we must use all sorts
of devices and techniques to weaken those tigers day by day rather than
trying to kill them outright. This intense search for a way of escape
(Patisankhanupassana - nana) constitutes the seventh step in the
Knowledge and Vision of the Progress along the Path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>h) This weakening of the defilements serves to make us
progressively more and more independent of and oblivious to things. So
this next step in the developing of right understanding, which results
in imperturbability with respect to all things, consists in seeing all
phenomena as empty, as devoid of essence, as devoid of status such as
"animal" or "person," devoid of substance or real permanence, devoid of
worth because they are thoroughly unsatisfactory, and devoid of all
attraction because they are thoroughly disenchanting. Ultimately the
mind becomes independent of and unperturbed by anything in any realm of
existence. Things formerly likable, desirable and infatuating, come to
be seen as lumps of rock and earth.</p>
<p>This too has been explained by means of a simile. A man who
has always loved a certain woman may one day experience a change of
heart and stop loving her. For instance, he will stop loving his wife
if she is unfaithful. Once divorced, however, he is free to go ahead
and do as he pleases; his mind can be unperturbed. And at this level of
knowledge, conditions hitherto delightful, each in its own way, are
recognized as devoid of substance, so that one can be independent of
them and unperturbed by them in all circumstances, just like the man
who becomes independent on divorcing his wife. This indifference to all
phenomena (Sankharupekkha - nana) is the eighth step. i) The mind thus
independent of and unmoved by all phenomenal existence is ready to
perfect the Path and know the Four Noble Truths (Saccanulomika - nana).
At this stage one is all set to overcome the defilements, to break the
fetters binding one to the world, and become an Aryian of one degree or
another. This is the ninth step in the process of Knowledge and Vision
of the Progress along the Path. When this stepwise developing of
knowledge, from knowledge of arising and passing away up to the state
of readiness to perceive the Four Noble Truths, has been carried
through to completion, one is said to have achieved the fourth state in
vipassana, or the sixth Purification. The pure and perfect knowledge it
yields is an instrument that reveals to the meditator the path by which
he has come, and can lead on to the perfect intuitive insight that will
destroy the defilements. This perfect intuitive insight, or Purity of
Knowledge and Vision, the seventh Purification, is the insight that
arises out of the perfected Path. It is the goal, the Fruit of
vipassana practice. This insight that arises out of the perfected Path
is the fifth and final stage in vipassana. In between the state of
readiness to perceive the Noble Truths and this perfect intuitive
insight comes "qualifying" knowledge (Gotrabhu - nana), which marks the
point of transition from the ordinary defiled individual to the Aryian.
But this qualifying knowledge lasts only an instant. It is the
culmination of the progressive perfection of knowledge and is still at
the level of good karma, still in the sensual realm. To sum up, then,
vipassana has as its foundation morality and concentration. What do we
examine? The answer is: We examine all things, or to use other terms,
the world, or phenomenal existence, or conditioned things, or the five
aggregates, since all phenomenal existence consists of nothing apart
from the five aggregates. What do we aim at seeing as a result of this
scrutiny? We aim at seeing the transience, the unsatisfactoriness, the
non-selfhood inherent in all things in the world. We observe them
arising, persisting and ceasing until we come to perceive them as
absolutely fearsome and disenchanting, and realize that nothing is
worth getting or being. These are the conditions that ought to arise in
vipassana practice. What is the objective of vipassana? The immediate
objective of vipassana is to reduce delusion, the meaning of
"vipassana" being "clear vision." What is the fruit of vipassana? The
fruit is the arising of clear intuitive insight, clear and enduring
insight into the nature of all things, which ultimately will reduce the
defilements to nothing. With the defilements gone, there is just
perfection, enlightenment, peace. Nothing remains to bind the mind to
any worldly condition. As a result, there comes about a slipping free
from the world, this place of slavery to sensuality. The mind is freed
of suffering because it's freed for good of all craving or desire. The
Buddha called this the attainment of the cessation of suffering, the
attainment of the Fruit of the Path, Nirvana. To have achieved this is
to have carried out to completion the task Buddhism has set for us.</p>
<p>This shows us the path of insight that has to be walked. There are
seven stages of Purification which must be integrated in this way, and
nine steps in the process of developing knowledge of the world. These
taken together are known as vipassana. In the Texts it is set out as an
ordered system. The finer details can be found in the books written by
later teachers. There is one important thing that must be realized,
however, in order to avoid misunderstanding. It so happens that even in
the field of Dhamma practice, the highest aspect of Buddhism, there are
misguided people. At the present time there are many who have got hold
of things that are not vipassana at all and are presenting them as
being the real thing. They have made vipassana practice their means of
livelihood. They win people over in order to get classes together, then
proceed to certify them as noble ones (Ariyapuggala), modern style, all
of which is most despicable and regrettable.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Chapter 9: &nbsp;Emancipation From The World</a></p>

<p>Vipassana meditation is mental training aimed at raising the
mind to such a level that it is no longer subject to suffering. The
mind breaks free from suffering by virtue of the clear knowledge that
nothing is worth grasping at or clinging to. This knowledge deprives
worldly things of their ability to lead the mind into further
thoughtless liking or disliking. Having this knowledge, the mind
transcends the worldly condition and attains the level known as the
Supramundane Plane (Lokuttara-bhumi). In order to comprehend clearly
the supramundane plane, we have to know first about its opposite, the
mundane plane (Lokiyabhumi). The mundane plane comprises those levels
at which the things of the world have control over the mind. Very
briefly, three levels are recognized in the mundane plane, namely: the
sensual level (Kamavacara-bhumi), or the level of a mind still content
with pleasures of every kind; the level of forms (Rupavacara-bhumi),
the condition of a mind uninterested in sensual objects, but finding
satisfaction in the various stages of concentration on forms as
objects; and lastly the formless level (Arupavacara-bhumi), the yet
higher level of a mind finding satisfaction in the bliss and peace of
concentration on objects other than forms. These three levels in the
worldly plane are the mental levels of beings in general. Regardless of
whether we presume to call them human beings, celestial beings, gods,
beasts, or denizens of hell, they are all included within the three
worldly levels. The mind of a worldling can at any particular time
exist in any one of these three. It is not impossible. It is quite
normal. As a rule, though, it will tend to fall back naturally to the
unconcentrated sensual level; the human mind normally falls under the
influence of the delightful in colors and shapes, sounds, odors, tastes
and tactile objects. Only on certain occasions is it able to escape
from the influence of these seductive things and experience the
tranquillity and bliss which comes from practicing concentration on
forms or other objects. It all depends on concentration. At certain
times, then, a person's mind may be located in any of these levels of
concentration. In India at the time of the Buddha this must have been
fairly common, because people who had gone in search of the
tranquillity and bliss associated with the various levels of
concentration were to be found living in forests all over the country.
At the present time such people are few, but it is nevertheless
possible for the ordinary man to attain these levels. If someone in
this world is in the process of experiencing the bliss of full
concentration on a form, then for him "the world" consists of just that
form, because he is aware of nothing else. At that time and for that
person, "the world" is equivalent to just that one form, and it remains
so until such time as his mental condition changes.</p>
<p>Even though a person dwelling in any of these three levels may
have gained such bliss and calm tranquillity that he has come to
resemble a rock, a lump of earth, or a log of wood, yet grasping and
clinging to selfhood are still present. Also present are various kinds
of desire, albeit of the finest and most tenuous sort, such as
dissatisfaction with the state in which he finds himself, which prompts
him to go in search of a new state. That desire for change constitutes
karma, so such a person has not yet transcended the worldly state. He
is not yet in the supramundane plane. A mind dwelling in the
supramundane plane has transcended the world. It views the worldly
state as devoid of essence, self, or substance, and will have nothing
of it. Dwellers in this supramundane plane can be further classified
into grades. There are four levels of Path and Fruit, namely the levels
of the Stream - enterer (Sotapanna), the Once - returner(Skidagami),
the Never - returner (Anagami), and the completely Perfected individual
or Arahant. The condition of these four kinds of noble individuals or
Aryians is the supramundane condition. "Supramundane" means "above the
world," and refers to the mind, not the body. The body can be anywhere
at all as long as living conditions are adequate. "Supramundane" simply
describes a mind dwelling above the world. As for the nether worlds
such as hell, purgatory, or the places of suffering, torment and
bondage, these are out of the question for the Aryians. The criteria
for recognizing these four levels in the supramundane plane are the
various mental impurities which are in the course of being eliminated.
The Buddha divided the impurities in this group into ten kinds. He
called them the Fetters (Samyojana). These ten fetters bind man and all
beings to the world, keeping people in the mundane plane. If a person
starts to cut through these fetters and break loose, his mind gradually
and progressively becomes freed from the worldly condition; and when he
manages to cut through them completely, his mind becomes completely
free, transcends the world for good and comes to dwell permanently in
the supramundane plane. Of these ten kinds of subtle mental impurities
that bind us, the first is the Self belief (Sakkaya-ditthi), the view
that the body and mind is "my self." It is a misunderstanding or
misconception based on clinging to the idea "I am." Because the average
person is not aware of the true nature of the body and the mind, he
unthinkingly regards these two as his "self." He assumes that body and
mind is his "self," his "I." This instinctive idea that there is an "I"
and a "mine" is so firmly ingrained that normally nobody ever doubts
their existence. True, the self instinct is what makes life possible,
being the basis of self preservation, the search for food and
propagation of the species, but in this case, what we are calling the
self belief is to be taken only in its most basic sense as the root
cause of selfishness. This is considered to be the first of the
fetters, to be done away with before anything else.</p>
<p>The second fetter is Doubt (Vicikiccha), the cause of wavering and
uncertainty. Most importantly it is doubt concerning the practice
leading to liberation from suffering-doubt due to inadequate knowledge,
doubt as to what this subject is really all about, doubt as to whether
this practice for breaking free from suffering is really the right
thing for one, whether one is really capable of carrying it through,
whether it is really better than other things, whether or not it really
does any good, whether the Buddha really did attain enlightenment,
whether he really did achieve liberation from suffering, whether the
Buddha's teaching and the practical method based on his teaching really
do lead to liberation from suffering, whether it is really possible for
a bhikkhu in the Sangha to attain liberation from suffering. The root
cause of hesitancy is ignorance. A fish that has always lived in the
water, if told about life on dry land, would be sure to believe none of
it, or at most only half of it. We, immersed as we are in sensuality,
are as habituated to sensuality as is the fish to water, so that when
someone speaks of transcending sensuality, transcending the world, we
can't under stand. And that which we can understand to some extent we
are hesitant about. It is natural for us to think on this lower level;
to think on the high level produces a new picture. The conflict between
the high level thinking and the low level thinking is what constitutes
wavering. If mental energy is insufficient, the low level thinking will
triumph. Doubt and wavering with regard to goodness is something
chronically present in everyone right from birth. In a person who has
been brought up wrongly, it may be a very common complaint. We have to
introspect and note the bad consequences of this wavering, which is
present to such an extent in our work and our everyday living that we
become skeptical about goodness, truth and liberation from suffering.
The third fetter is Superstition (Silabbatapraramasa) or attachment to
rules and rituals based on a misunderstanding of their real purpose.
Essentially it is a misguided attachment to certain things one does.
Usually it has to do with doctrines and ceremonies. An example of this
is belief in magic and magical practices, which is blatantly just
superstition and occurs even among Buddhists. Practice based on the
belief that it will produce magical abilities, psychic powers and
protective forces is founded on false hopes and is irrational. Another
example is the undertaking of moral precepts (Five Precepts, etc.) or
virtuous conduct. The real purpose of this is to eliminate mental
defilements; but if we believe that it will give rise to miraculous
powers which we shall then be able to use to eradicate the defilements,
we are in fact grasping and clinging, and so defeating our original
purpose. The practice is quite correct in itself, but if we
misunderstand it and cling to it irrationally, regarding it as
something magical or sacred, then it becomes pure superstition. Even
taking upon oneself the moral precepts, if done in the belief that it
will lead to rebirth as a celestial being, is without a doubt an
example of attachment to rules and rituals and goes contrary to
Buddhist aims. Such beliefs contaminate otherwise virtuous conduct. The
objective of the Buddhist discipline is the elimination of the cruder
defilements of body and speech as a foundation for the progressive
development of concentration and insight.</p>
<p> The objective is not rebirth in heaven. To have such false
motives is to soil and contaminate one's own morals with grasping and
clinging, with false ideas. Charity, or adherence to moral precepts, or
meditation practice, if carried out with a mistaken idea of their true
objective. inevitably will stray from the Buddhist path. Do understand
that even Buddhist practice associated with misunderstanding because
craving has come in and taken over, bringing the expectation of
mystical powers, becomes superstition instead. This applies to even the
very small and trivial things that most of us like to indulge in, such
as ritual chanting, merit making and the like. The ceremony of placing
rice and trays of sweets before the Buddha's image, if performed in the
belief that it is an offering to the Buddha's "spirit" and that he will
be able to partake of it, is 100 percent certain to produce effects
precisely the opposite of what the devotee is hoping for. Behavior that
defeats its own true purpose is generally quite common in Buddhist
circles. It is foolish and irrational and results in practices
originally worthwhile and attractive becoming contaminated with the
stupidity and ignorance of the people performing them. This is what is
meant by superstition. As we can see, this defilement has its origins
in delusion and misunderstanding. Most of us have our own ingrown
beliefs in mystical powers as a result of having been misinformed and
led astray by others. We need not go into any more detail here; but
though it may be rather disturbing, everyone ought to do some critical
self-examination along these lines.</p>
<p>When these first three defilements, namely self belief, doubt
and superstition, have been completely given up, one is said to have
attained the lowest level in the supramundane plane, that is, to have
become a Stream enterer. To give up completely these three defilements
is not difficult at all, because they are just primitive qualities
possessed by primitive, under-developed people. In anyone who has
studied well and made progress, these three elements should not be
present; and if they are, then that person's mind should be considered
still primitive. Anyone ought to be able to give up these three
defilements and become an Aryian. If he can't he is still a foolish and
deluded person, or, to use the best term, a worldling (Puthujjana),
someone with a thick blindfold covering the eye of insight . When any
individual has managed to give up these defilements, his mind is freed
from bondage to the world. These three are ignorance and delusion
obscuring the truth and are fetters binding the mind to the world.
Giving them up is like rendering ineffective three kinds of bondage or
three blind folds, then slipping free and rising above and beyond the
world, into the first supramundane level. This is what it is to become
an Aryian of the first degree, to attain the first level in the
supramundane plane. Such an individual is called a "Stream - enterer,"
one who has attained for the first time the Stream that flows on to
Nirvana. In other words an individual at this stage is certain to
attain Nirvana at some time in the future. What he has attained is only
the Stream of Nirvana, not Nirvana itself. This Stream is a course that
flows right on to Nirvana, inclining towards Nirvana just as the
water-course of a river slopes down towards the sea. Though it may
still take some time, a mind which has once entered the Stream is
certain to achieve Nirvana eventually. Attaining the second level in
the supramundane plane implies giving up the three fetters just
mentioned, and further, being able to attenuate certain types of
craving, aversion and delusion to such a degree that the mind becomes
elevated and only very feebly attached to sensuality. It is
traditionally held that an individual who achieves this level will
return to this world at most only once more, hence he is known as a
"Once - returner." A Once - returner is closer to Nirvana than a Stream
- enterer, there remaining in him no more than a trace of worldliness.
Should he return to the sensual human world, he will do so not more
than once, because craving, aversion and delusion, though not
completely eliminated, have become exceedingly attenuated. The third
stage is that of the Never - returner. This grade of Aryian, besides
having succeeded in giving up the defilements to the extent necessary
for becoming a Once - returner, has also managed to give up the fourth
and fifth fetters. The Fourth fetter is sensual desire and the fifth is
ill will. Neither the Stream - enterer nor the Once - returner has
completely given up sensual desire. In both of them there is still a
remnant of satisfaction in alluring and desirable objects. Even though
they have managed to give up self belief, doubt and superstition, they
are still unable to relinquish completely their attachment to
sensuality of which some traces remain. But an Aryian at the third
stage, a Never - returner, has succeeded in giving it up completely, so
that not a trace remains. The defilement called ill will, which
includes all feelings of anger or resentment, has been washed out to a
large extent by the Once - returner so that there remains only a trace
of ill humor to obstruct his mind; but the Never - returner has got rid
of it altogether. Thus the Never - returner has thrown off both sensual
desire and ill will. This sensual desire or attachment to and
satisfaction in sensuality was explained adequately in the section on
sensual attachment. It is a chronic defilement, firmly fixed in the
mind as if it were a very part of it, of the same substance. For the
ordinary man, it is hard to understand and hard to eradicate. Anything
at all can serve as an object for desire: colors and shapes, sounds,
odors, tastes and tactile objects of any sort, kind and description.
These are sensual objects (Kama), and the state of mental attachment
which takes the form of satisfaction in these desirable objects is
sensual desire (Kama - raga). What we call ill will is the reaction of
a mind that feels dissatisfaction. If there is satisfaction, there is
sensual desire; if dissatisfaction, ill will. Most people's minds are
subject to these two states. There may arise ill will towards even
inanimate objects, and what is more, one can even be dissatisfied with
the things one has produced oneself, the things that arise in one's own
mind. Where there is actual hatred and anger towards an object, ill
will has become too fierce. An Aryian at a stage below the Non -
returnee has given it up to a degree appropriate to his station. The
ill will that remains for the third grade of Aryian to relinquish is
just a mental reaction so subtle that possibly no outward evidence of
it appears. It is an inner perturbation not revealed by any facial
expression, yet present inwardly as dissatisfaction, as irritation or
annoyance at some person or thing that does not conform to expectation.
Imagine a person completely devoid of every form of ill will: consider
what a very exceptional individual he would be, and how worthy of
respect. The five defilements we have just been discussing were grouped
together by the Buddha as the first to be given up. Self belief, doubt,
superstition, sensual desire and ill will have all been given up by an
Aryian at the third level. Because there remains no sensual desire,
this grade of Aryian never again returns to the sensual state of
existence. This is why he gets the name "Never - returner," one who
will never come back. For him there is only movement forward and upward
to Arahantship and Nirvana, in a state having nothing to do with
sensuality, a supreme, divine condition. As for the five remaining
defilements, these only the Arahant, the fourth grade of Aryian,
succeeds in relinquishing completely.</p>
<p>The next defilement, the sixth of the fetters, is desire for
the bliss associated with the various stages of concentration on forms
(rupa - raga). The first three grades of Aryian are still not capable
of giving up attachment to the bliss and tranquillity obtainable by
concentrating deeply on forms, but they will succeed in doing so when
they move up to the last stage, that of the Arahant. The fully
concentrated state has a captivating flavor, which can be described as
a foretaste of Nirvana. Though it differs from real Nirvana, it has
more or less the same flavor. While one is fully concentrated, the
defilements are dormant; but they have not evaporated away entirely,
and will reappear as soon as concentration is lost. As long as they are
dormant, however, the mind is empty, clear, free, and knows the flavor
of real Nirvana. Consequently this state can also become a cause of
attachment. The seventh subtle defilement is desire for the bliss
associated with full concentration on objects other than forms (arupa -
raga). It resembles the sixth fetter, but is one degree more subtle and
attenuated. Concentration on an object such as space or emptiness
yields a tranquillity and quiescence more profound than concentration
on a form, with the result that one becomes attached to that state. No
Arahant could ever become fascinated by any state of pleasant feeling
whatsoever, regardless of where it originated, because an Arahant is
automatically aware of the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and
nonselfhood of every state of feeling. Other hermits and mystics
practicing concentration in the forest do not perceive the hidden
danger in these blissful states and so become fascinated by and
attached to the flavor of them just as immature people become attached
to the flavor of sensual objects. For this reason the Buddha used the
same word "desire" for both cases. If you think this subject over and
really come to understand it, you will be full of admiration and
respect for these individuals called Aryians. The eighth fetter binding
a man to the world is awareness of superiority or inferiority (mana).
It is the delusion of having this or that status relative to another.
It consists in the thought: "I am not as good as he is. I am just as
good as he is. I am better or higher than he is." Thinking "I am not as
good as...," one feels inferior; thinking "I am better than...," one
feels puffed up; and thinking "I am just as good as...," one thinks
along competitive lines or in terms of getting ahead of the other
fellow. It is not pride or conceit. Not to think automatically of
oneself as better or worse than the other fellow in this fashion is
bound to be very difficult. The placing of this defilement as number
eight is probably meant to indicate that it is hard to give up and so
belongs near the end of the list. Only the highest grade of Aryian can
relinquish it. The likes of us naturally can't give it up. This idea
that one is better than, or on a par with, or not as good as the other
fellow, comes from a certain kind of attachment. As long as the mind is
still involved in good and bad, the awareness of inferiority,
superiority, or equality with respect to others remains to disturb it;
but when it has completely transcended good and bad, such ideas cannot
exist. As long as such ideas do remain, real bliss and tranquillity are
lacking.</p>
<p>The ninth fetter is Agitation (Uddhacca), that is, mental
unrest, distraction, lack of peace and quiet. This is the feeling of
agitation that arises when something interesting comes by. We all have
certain chronic wishes, particularly a desire to get, to be, not to
get, or not to be, one thing or another. When something comes by, via
the eye, ear, nose, tongue, or body, which fits in with one of our
tendencies, there is likely to come about the mental reaction, pro or
con, which we call interest. If we see something new and strange,
wavering and curiosity are bound to arise, because there are still
things that we want and things that we fear and mistrust. So the mind
cannot resist, it has to be interested in the various things that come
by- at least that is how it is with an ordinary person. If the object
in question happens to coincide with a desire of his, he finds it hard
to resist. He is likely to become interested to the point of becoming
involved, pleased to the point of forgetting himself. If it is an
undesirable object, the mind becomes depressed so that his
gratification comes to an end. This is the nature of Agitation. The
first three grades of Aryian still have curiosity and inquisitiveness
about things, but the Arahant has none at all. His mind has abolished
all desire for anything whatsoever: it has abolished fear and hatred,
worry and anxiety, mistrust and doubt, and all desire to know about and
see things. His mind is free. Nothing can provoke or lure him, and
arouse inquisitiveness or curiosity, simply because he has abolished
partiality. It should be realized that the existence or arising of
agitation in any situation is a consequence of some form of desire,
even including the desire for knowledge. When desire has been done away
with through realizing the impermanence, worthlessness and nonselfhood
of all things, nothing is any longer seen as worth getting or being,
and so there is no curiosity about anything. If a bolt of lightning
were to strike right beside an Arahant, he would not be interested,
because he has no fear of death, or craving for continued existence, or
anything of that sort. Even if something dangerous came along, or if
something brand new were discovered in the world, he would know no
inquisitiveness or curiosity, because such things have no significance
for him. He has no wish to know about anything from the point of view
of what it may have to offer him. Because there is nothing that he
longs for, he has no curiosity of any kind, and his mind has a purity,
a tranquillity such as we ordinary folk have never attained. The tenth
and last defilement is Ignorance. This covers every kind of defilement
not yet mentioned. The word "ignorance" refers to a condition of lack
of knowledge, and in this case "knowledge" means real knowledge,
correct knowledge. Naturally no creature can exist without having some
knowledge, but if that knowledge is false, it has the same value as no
knowledge. Most people suffer from chronic ignorance or false
knowledge; most of us are benighted. The most important questions for
human beings are those that ask: "What is suffering, really?," "What is
the real cause of the arising of suffering?," "What is real freedom
from suffering?" and "What is the real way to attain freedom from
suffering?" If some individual has real knowledge, if he is free of
ignorance, he is reckoned as enlightened. The totality of human
knowledge is of untold extent, but the Buddha classed most of it as not
essential. The Buddha's enlightenment encompassed only what need be
known. The Buddha knew all that need be known. The word "omniscient" or
"all - knowing" means knowing just as much as need be known: it does
not include anything non-essential.</p>
<p>Ignorance causes people to misidentify suffering as pleasure,
to such an extent that they just swim around in circles in a sea of
suffering. It also causes them to misidentify the cause of suffering,
so that they go blaming the wrong things, spirits, celestial beings, or
anything at all as the cause of their pain and misfortune, instead of
rectifying the situation by the right means. The making of vows to
these spirits and celestial beings is a manifestation of the lowest
level of ignorance regarding the complete elimination of suffering by
means of eliminating the craving which is its direct cause. The
mistaken assumption that the bliss and tranquillity or unawareness
brought about by deep concentration is the complete extinction of
suffering was common in the Buddha's time, and is still promoted in the
present day. Certain schools of thought have even come to regard
sensuality as an instrument for extinguishing suffering, so that sects
with shameful, obscene practices have arisen right in the temples. They
firmly believe that sensuality is something quite essential, a kind of
vital nourishment. Not content with just the four necessities of life,
namely food, clothing, shelter and medicine, they add an extra one,
sensuality, making five necessities. A person ignorant about the Path
that leads to the extinction of suffering is liable to act foolishly
and be motivated by his own desires, for instance naively relying on
physical things, or on spirits and celestial beings, just as if he had
no religion at all. Such a person, though he may be a Buddhist by
birth, is able to go to such foolish lengths simply because the power
of ignorance prevents his being content with extinguishing suffering by
way of the Noble Eightfold Path. Instead he goes about extinguishing
suffering by lighting incense and candles, and making pledges to
supposedly supernatural things. Every normal person wishes to gain
knowledge; but if the "knowledge" he gains is false, then the more he
"knows,"' the more deluded he becomes. Thus more kinds of knowledge can
blind the eyes. We have to be careful with this word "enlightenment."
The "Light" may be the glare of ignorance, which blinds and deludes the
eye and gives rise to overconfidence. Blinded by the glare of
ignorance, we are unable to think straight and so are in no position to
defeat suffering. We waste our time with trivialities, nonessential
things unworthy of our respect. We become infatuated with sensuality,
taking it to be something excellent and essential for human beings,
something which every man ought to get his share of before he dies, and
making the excuse that we are doing it for the sake of some quite
different ideal. The hope for rebirth in heaven is founded on
sensuality. Attachment to anything whatsoever, particularly sensuality
comes about because ignorance has enveloped the mind cutting off all
means of escape. At several places in the Texts, ignorance is compared
to a thick shell covering the whole world and preventing people from
seeing the real light.</p>
<p>The Buddha placed ignorance last in the list of the ten
fetters. When a person becomes an Arahant, the highest grade of Aryian,
he completely eliminates the five remaining fetters or defilements. He
eliminates desire for forms, desire for objects other than forms,
status consciousness, agitation and ignorance. The four kinds of
Aryian, Stream - enterer, Once - returner, Never - returner and
Arahant, dwell in the Supra mundane plane. The Supramundane can be
recognized as having nine aspects. The condition of the Stream -
enterer while he is in the process of cutting out the defilements is
called the Path of Stream entry, and that when he has succeeded in
cutting them out is called the Fruit of Stream entry. Likewise there
are the following pairs: Path and Fruit of Once returning, Path and
Fruit of Never returning and Path and Fruit of Arahantship, in all four
pairs. These together with Nirvana make up the nine aspects of the
Supramundane. For an individual in the supramundane plane, suffering is
diminished in accordance with his status until ultimately he is
completely free of it. When a person once succeeds in attaining
unobscured and perfect insight into the true nature of things so that
he is able to stop desiring anything whatsoever, he has attained the
supramundane plane, his mind has transcended the worldly condition. And
when he has completely and utterly relinquished all the mental
defilements, his mind is rendered permanently free of all those worldly
things which formerly it liked and disliked. Nirvana is a condition not
in any way comparable to any other. It is unlike any worldly condition.
In fact, it is the very negation of the worldly condition. Given all
the characteristics of the worldly condition, of phenomenal existence,
the result of completely canceling out all those characteristics is
Nirvana. That is to say, Nirvana is that which is in every respect
precisely the opposite of the worldly condition. Nirvana neither
creates nor is created, being the cessation of all creating. Speaking
in terms of benefits, Nirvana is complete freedom from hellfire,
scourging, torture, bondage, subjection and thralldom, because the
attainment of Nirvana presupposes the complete elimination of the
defilements, which are the cause of all unsatisfactory mental states.
Nirvana lies beyond the limitations of space and time. It is unique,
unlike anything in the world. Rather it is the extinction of the
worldly condition. Speaking metaphorically, the Buddha called it the
realm where all conditional things cease to be (Sankhara - samatho).
Hence it is the condition of freedom, of freedom from fetters. It is
the end of torment and buffeting, stabbing and chafing, from any source
whatsoever. This is the nature of the Supramundane, the ultimate. It is
the Buddhist goal and destination. It is the final fruit of Buddhist
practice. In the foregoing pages we have explained systematically the
principles of Buddhism. We have presented it as an organized practical
system designed to bring knowledge of the true nature of things. In
reality things are impermanent, unsatisfactory and not selves; but all
creatures are attracted by things and become attached to them simply
through misunderstanding. The Buddhist practice, based on Morality
(Sila), Concentration (Samadhi), and Insight (Panna), is a tool to be
used for completely cutting out grasping and clinging. The objects of
our clinging are the five aggregates: body, feeling, perception, active
thinking and consciousness. When we have come to know the true nature
of the five aggregates, we understand all things so well that desire
gives way to disenchantment, and we no longer cling to any of them.
What we have to do is lead the kind of life described as Right Living
(Samma Vihareyyum), and be full day and night with the joy that arises
out of conduct that is consistently good, beautiful and right. This
limits aimless wandering of the thoughts and makes it possible to
concentrate and to have clear insight at all times. Then if conditions
are right, the result is disenchantment, struggle to break loose,
slipping free, or even complete Nirvana. If we wish to hurry and gain
quick results, then there is the line of practice called Vipassana,
which begins with moral purity and mental purity and carries right
through to perfect and unobscured intuitive insight. By this means we
can completely cut through the fetters that bind us fast to this world,
and attain the final Fruit of the Path. This is a brief account of the
whole of Buddha-Dhamma from beginning to end, including both
theoretical and practical principles, and covering the entire subject
right from the first steps to the final Fruit. The whole story ends
with Nirvana. As the Buddha said: "All Buddhas recognize Nirvana as the
highest good." So it behooves us to practice in order to realize and
attain that which should be realized and attained. Doing this, we shall
deserve to be called Buddhists; we shall gain insight and penetrate to
the real essence of BuddhaDhamma. If we don't practice Buddha-Dhamma,
we shall only know about it and shall lack any true insight. It rests
with each of us to practice introspection, observe and understand his
own imperfections, and then try to root them out completely. Even if
one is only half successful, some clear understanding will result. As
the defilements are progressively eliminated, their place is taken by
purity, insight and peace. So I advise and beseech you to approach the
subject in this fashion. You may then succeed in penetrating to the
real Buddha- Dhamma. Don't waste the advantages of having been born a
human being and having encountered the Buddha's teaching. Don't miss
this chance to be a perfect human being.</p>
