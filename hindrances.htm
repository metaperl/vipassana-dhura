<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Coping With Hindrances: Edmonton Talk #3</a></p>
<p>
This morning: about continuity. What is the meaning of
continuity? First we provide an object [for mindfulness]
to continue with. We follow the step-by-step,
moment-to-moment technique. We set up the first foundation
of mindfulness, the body, by maintaining continuity
between sitting standing, walking, and sitting again.
</p>
<p>
Or, when doing something else, we also keep the
step-by-step technique. We move the hands to the abdomen
one at a time before standing up or walking. We walk
step-by-step from one step through six step and then go
back to sitting. When the object is continuous, [i.e.,
when one keeps noting objects from one moment to the next,
without a break] mindfulness will follow the object until
mindfulness gains experience to be steady at the level. At
that time we give up the step-by-step [technique] and give
up labeling [the object with mental notes]. We return to
normal, right? To natural life - just walk, just do it.
Mindfulness will separate ultimate truth and ordinary
truth. Even when memory can remember [the name of an
object] according to ordinary truth, mindfulness will keep
going with ultimate truth. Mindfulness will take care.
</p>
<p>
Usually meditators don't understand how to keep
continuity. Sometimes you feel sleepy. You're not
aware of the object; when you wake up you have to continue
from there. Don't worry about how long you fall
asleep. When you wake up, just keep going from that
moment, continuously.
</p>
<p>
For example: outside there's sunshine when its
daytime. But sometimes big clouds pass over the sun. Maybe
it's a long time until we get sunlight on the ground
again. While the clouds cover the sun there's no
bright light on the ground. That's all right. When the
clouds pass, the sun will continue to shine, right?
That's the point. Like the trees outside that cast
shadows. When clouds cover the sun, the shadows are gone;
but when the clouds pass away, the shadows are still
there. As soon as they appear again the shadows begin to
move a little bit, as the sun moves. It's the same
thing with the mind; it doesn't matter how long it
wanders out, since you continue with your duty to watch
it.
</p>
<p>
Just like when you go to a concert or a show. When you buy
a ticket you have a seat to sit in. When the actors appear
onstage you just keep to your duty of watching them. You
still sit in your seat. The actors come and go onstage.
One goes behind the curtain and you wait for another to
come out. You just have the duty to sit and watch.
It's not your job to jump onstage, to take a role in
the play, right? You do not move or take a break from
watching the stage.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it takes a few minutes before the actor comes
on. But you just keep watching, keep seeing, by your duty.
Don't become part of the play! Don't become an
actor yourself. You only have the duty to see. The actors
have the duty to show. Whether the play is good or bad is
the actors' responsibility, not yours. Whether the
show is good or bad is not up to you. When the show is
good, you know that it's good. When it's bad, you
know it's bad. Just knowing. Just seeing. Don't
attach with a good show; don't resist a bad show. In
this way you keep to your duty of just seeing.
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="sometimes"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Sometimes There's No Object</a></p>

<p>
Sometimes there's no object. When the actors
aren't showing anything you still have the duty to sit
there. You don't leave the theatre. If you go out you
have broken the continuity. Then you have to buy a ticket
again. You have to find another seat. That means that your
attention is not continuous. But if you stay that means
you are practicing continuity.
</p>
<p>
Here you sit for forty or forty-five minutes. Sometimes
you have wandering mind for five minutes, for example.
Sometimes you fall asleep for a few minutes. Sometimes
emotion arises. It doesn't matter. As soon as you
realize that the mind has wandered, begin again from that
point. When you wake up, just continue right away. You
shouldn't care about how long the mind wandered or how
long you fell asleep. Don't worry about that. When you
know that the mind has wandered, just continue from that
moment, more and more. You will not have broken
continuity. You'll be on the correct path.
</p>
<p>
The "step" of mindfulness is not the same length
as the step of walking, for example. The step of
mindfulness can be very, very short, a very small period
of time, or very sharp. [I.e., in the duration of one step
of the foot, the meditator can experience many moments
arising and vanishing, one after another, if mindfulness
is strong enough.]
</p>
<p>
But sometimes you have wandering mind for five minutes.
Right before the mind wanders off you still have
mindfulness; but then there is a five minute gap. At the
end of five minutes you realize that the mind had wandered
and you bring it back to the present. We can call this a
"long" step of mindfulness. That is, there is a
big gap, a long period of time, between two consecutive
moments of mindfulness. But that's not wrong because
you have not broken continuity.
</p>
<p>
As soon as you are aware of a lapse, you continue with the
practice; you return to observing objects from
moment-to-moment right away. Sometimes you can jump from
one moment to the next; sometimes there will be a longer
gap. But the important thing is that when you lose your
awareness for a few moments you do not get upset.
Don't wonder why you wandered off.
</p>
<p>
Don't think "How come I don't have
concentration?" or "Why did I fall asleep? Why
don't I have energy?" or something like that.
Don't wonder about the reason you fell asleep, because
there is no reason. Sleepiness has no reason; it just
appears by the duty of the hindrances. [The five
hindrances to meditation are: lust, sleepiness,
restlessness, anger, and doubt.] Don't try to find out
why the mind wanders or why you are thinking, because it
is the duty of the mind to think. If it doesn't think,
then it isn't a mind, it's a table. Only material
things never think.
</p>
<p>
That's why, when you are thinking, or you feel emotion
or another hindrance arise, don't care about it. Just
focus and forget it. Whichever hindrance shows itself,
just look at it and focus so as to see that one. Just keep
watching the object that is clear. Sometimes two or three
actors appear, but it doesn't matter which one you
watch. For instance, sometimes you keep going with rising
and falling; it's very clear. At that time you
don't care about any sounds you may hear. Even if the
"actor" called emotion arises you don't
care, you're not interested.
</p>
<p>
When you see a play, you let the actors perform until they
have finished their lines. Then they leave the stage by
themselves. You don't worry that they will stay
onstage forever. It's the same with emotion, or
wandering mind, or sleepiness. As all of these things are
happening, just keep observing the one that is easiest to
continue with. Except when you fall asleep; then you
don't have an object to continue with. But it's
only for a short time until you wake up. When you wake up,
just start again from that point, all right?
</p>
<p>
That's the meaning of continuity when practicing
mindfulness. Don't lose double. When the mind wanders
you have lost once already; that is, you have lost the
object that you were observing - rising-falling, for
instance. But when you become angry that the mind has
wandered, when you think, "Why does this happen when
I try to keep continuity? Why am I practicing
incorrectly?" you have lost twice. You lose double.
[The longer you worry about losing mindfulness, the more
objects slip by unnoticed. The more moments you have
"lost."] That creates more and more space
between moments of mindfulness. The gap during which
delusion takes place becomes wider and wider. That's
what it means to lose continuity.
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="goodorbad"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Good or Bad Feelings</a></p>

<p>
Good or bad feelings cannot approve our practice. Some
meditators make the mistake of feeling happy when a period
of sitting is nice and quiet and they don't have
wandering mind. They think, 'Wow, now I'm a good,
successful meditator. I don't mind that I came here.
I'm getting a lot of benefit." But the next
sitting isn't the same. Maybe their minds wander a lot
and they think, "Oh, this is terrible. Maybe
meditation cannot help me." They are disappointed and
sad. Maybe they lose confidence and energy. That's
wrong view. They don't understand that everything is
impermanent. Even if the sitting is good this time, it has
to end; and when good ends, bad occurs. The end of good is
bad. When the next sitting is bad, why worry? Bad has to
have an end. Maybe the next sitting will be good. Even if
it isn't, that's ok. It cannot be bad the whole
day, right? You have to have good sometimes, have to have
quiet or calmness sometimes. But when the mind is calm or
peaceful, don't attach, because it cannot last too
long, cannot last all day. Sometimes practice will be bad.
So do not worry about good or bad.
</p>
<p>
A student that I was interviewing said to me, "Oh, it
is very good. My mind is calm. I have strong
concentration. I feel happy and peaceful." But I told
him, "Bad." [Laughs.] "No good."
Because, when you attach with peacefulness, how can you
kill the defilements? How can you see what [unwholesome]
emotions are still there? "That's
ignorance," I said. Like the snake in the anthill -
if it doesn't come out, how can you kill it? How can
you know how many snakes are in the anthill? You cannot
know. You cannot know and you cannot kill them. So you are
always afraid when you pass the anthill, afraid that the
snake will come out.
</p>
<p>
So don't worry or think that you need strong
concentration when you practice insight meditation.
Insight meditation is for shaking delusion and emotion to
make them arise more and more - that's good. It's
good for mindfulness to have an object. It's good for
your practice. If there's no object, how can
mindfulness grow? Wandering mind and emotions are food for
mindfulness. By ordinary truth, you see a beautiful
picture or an ugly picture; you hear a beautiful voice
singing or you hear bad words. All of these objects around
you are food for defilements. They are the food of greed,
of hatred or of delusion.
</p>
<p>
But rising-falling, sitting, standing, consciousness
objects, wandering mind, feeling or emotion - all of these
are the food of mindfulness. When the body has enough food
it becomes strong. Same thing: when mindfulness has a lot
of food, has many things to eat, it becomes strong. Then,
instead of feeding the defilements, we're feeding
mindfulness, you see? That's why - don't be afraid
of the food for mindfulness. Let mindfulness
"eat" wandering mind or emotion or every kind of
object. Mindfulness has to have an object to focus on,
food to eat; and it has to have experience with eating
these things.
</p>

<a name="moggallana"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Moggallana</a></p>

<p>
Moggallana was the left-hand disciple of Lord Buddha. When
he was practicing for seven days he fell asleep all the
time. Sometimes he'd wake up a little but then fall
asleep again. He used a lot of energy to fight with
sleepiness. But when sleepiness was too strong he had to
use stronger energy to get mindfulness strong too, to make
it go up to the same level as sleepiness, so as to balance
with that hindrance, until mindfulness, energy and
concentration could grow stronger than sleepiness. They
could control it, could focus on sleepiness as an object
and see it arising and passing away, because it had no
power to stay. Mindfulness was stronger. He could see
sleepiness arise and fall away until he could see
impermanence, suffering and nonself clearly. He became
enlightened.
</p>
<p>
When he became enlightened he had a strong mind with very
strong psychic powers because he'd had a strong
partner to fight with. Like a person who wants to be a
boxing champion; he finds many sparring partners to fight
with until he becomes strong enough to win every match. In
the same way, right mindfulness can have many, many
sparring partners to fight with, to test it. If you
understand this you can continue in every moment, with
every object, all the time, from the first thing in the
morning until you go to bed, except when you're
sleeping for five or six hours. If you continue practicing
mindfulness until the moment of falling asleep, you will
not lose continuity. When you wake up you start from that
moment. You have to continue again as if there were no
daytime or nighttime. Mindfulness will continue all the
time. In that way you will not give a gap for delusion.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes mindfulness can stay in the sleep level, too,
but it's not strong enough. If it were strong you
would be an arahant [one who has reached the highest level
of enlightenment and is entirely free of greed, hatred and
delusion]. Even when asleep, arahants are mindful.
Becoming an arahant is the result of continuing to
practice from moment-to-moment. When we have not reached
that level yet we think it's impossible. But when we
reach that level we will see that it is possible.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned about myself. [Before practicing insight
meditation] I believed that it was impossible to forget my
name unless I was crazy. But I wasn't crazy. Why
couldn't I answer when someone called my name? Because
mindfulness separated ultimate truth and was not
interested in ordinary truth. It just kept observing
ultimate truth all the time very fast. So I could not
answer or feel happy when someone saw me or called me.
[Sopako Bhikkhu is referring to an experience he had
during a seven-month vipassana retreat. Some friends were
calling his name, trying to get his attention. His
mindfulness was so strong, however, that he couldn't
answer them. Why not? Because he was hearing the sound of
his own name purely as sound, without recognizing its
conventional meaning. Mindfulness was so sharp that it
disregarded the conventional and kept tracking only pure
phenomena. He was aware of "hearing," but not
the conventional meaning of the sound waves. That is what
it means to "just hear," or "just
see." Even when he had the impulse to answer his
friends, mindfulness kept bringing him back to the
immediate now, kept cutting off the impulse before he
could act upon it. Nor could he "feel happy"
because mindfulness cut off every emotion before it could
develop. Before taking up meditation practice, however, he
would have thought it impossible not to recognize
one's own name. Incidentally, his ability to
understand conventional speech returned as soon as
mindfulness went down.]
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="continuity"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Continuity is Possible</a></p>

<p>
So continuity is possible. Everything is possible if you
try to separate [ultimate truth from conventional] all the
time. What does "separate" mean? For example,
when doing the hand movements, try to forget about the
hand [Bhikkhu Sopako is referring to a meditation exercise
that uses hand motions. See, "How to Meditate."]
Just keep observing the object [motion] all the time. It
is the moment-to-moment of moving, not of the hand. If you
focus on the hand, that means that you only have
concentration. It is no different from repeating a mantra
[a sacred word or phrase used as a meditation object] -
you only get concentration, not wisdom. You cannot get
ultimate truth from memorizing a mantra. That's why I
say that some techniques from Tibet that use mantras, or
some Hindu techniques where they memorize a sutra, a
mantra or a kasina - all these are only for developing
concentration, because they do not have a complete object,
they do not observe nama [mind] and rupa [object] in the
present moment. It is not a direct way to ultimate truth.
</p>
<p>
In these [concentration] techniques one observes ordinary
[conventional] truth: the name of the thing, the name of
the sutra, the name of the Buddha. Like
"Buddho." They breathe in "Bud,"
breathe out, "dho." "Buddho, Buddho."
[This is a concentration technique where one repeats the
Buddha's name over and over.] Something like that,
right? Or even the technique where you concentrate on a
Buddha statue in front of you, looking at the Buddha's
shape until you have deep concentration. Consciousness
attaches with the object, the Buddha image. But the Buddha
image is ordinary truth. It is the name of the material.
But when they make the material into the shape of a Buddha
image, whether a Thai style or Japanese style or Chinese
style Buddha, that's ordinary truth. When we meditate
on ordinary truth objects we get no more than
concentration [i.e., not wisdom, not enlightenment].
</p>
<p>
When you separate your mind from ordinary truth there will
be ultimate truth: just seeing. Not seeing a Buddha image.
Just seeing color. What is it that sees? Nama sees. Not
"I am seeing." Rupa is the object of seeing. The
act of seeing means that nama and rupa appear or make
contact in the present moment, together, right now.
Mindfulness can stay in the moment of rupa and nama; it
can be aware of the bare phenomenon of seeing that arises
when looking at [what is conventionally called] the Buddha
image. That's the meaning of ultimate truth. Ultimate
truth is the correct path, the path of wisdom, the
eightfold path. It is the only way, the one way, to
nibbana.
</p>
<p>
So think about how you can continue with ultimate truth,
how you can keep going from moment-to-moment observing
nama and rupa. If you can separate [nama and rupa from
conventional reality] it is easy to practice anywhere,
anytime. At home or in the forest or in the town. You can
practice the right way or the right path anywhere, all
right?
</p>
<p>
If you don't understand, if you cannot separate, then
you mix it; sometimes insight meditation becomes
tranquility practice. How can you get a result? You just
feel peaceful or joyful sometimes when concentration goes
deeper. But sometimes you go to insight. You feel that
things are impermanent, you feel sad or afraid. You see
impermanence, suffering or nonself sometimes, but you
cannot continue by ultimate truth too long because you
cannot maintain continuity. Sometimes it changes to
tranquility, sometimes back to insight - back and forth
like this. That's why the meditator should feel
differently. Just keep going one way.
</p>
<p>
If you keep going by ordinary truth [as in concentration
meditation] you will get a deeper and deeper feeling of
peace and happiness from concentration until you enter a
trance. But if you keep going only by ultimate truth
[insight meditation], a certain kind of feeling should
arise in you step-by-step, from the first until the
sixteenth level of insight knowledge, until nibbana.
That's why we need to separate the object exactly.
</p>
<p>
If you cannot separate, you just go back and forth;
sometimes you label the object because you need more
concentration. Technically, that means that you have a
tranquility [concentration] object; but it's
tranquility in insight, because you don't keep to one
object like you do when concentrating on the Buddha image
or a kasina or a mantra.
</p>
<p>
Then [in the latter cases] you have the same object
always. That's pure tranquility. But when you keep
labeling rising-falling, or sitting, or label wandering
mind or an emotion that comes up, that's tranquility
in insight meditation. Until you give up the mental note,
then you'll be practicing pure insight. Now it's
not really pure, I know; not really pure now. Until I
interview you, then I will know who is pure [who is
practicing pure insight]! Pure or not I will know, all
right? [Laughter.] Do you have any more questions?
</p>
<p>
Meditator #1: Could you show us how to move the hands
between postures for continuity?
</p>
<p>
[Bhikkhu Sopako demonstrates the hand movement and
placement to be done between postures. This technique
prevents loss of mindfulness during transitions.]

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Interview with Meditators</a></p>

<p>
<b>Interview with Meditators</b>
</p>
<p>
<em>Note: We have referred to Bhikkhu Sopako as
"Achan" here, since that is how the meditators
address him. "Achan" is a title meaning
"teacher."</em>
</p>
<p>
Achan: Marie, how is your practice?
</p>
<p>
Marie: I seem to be having some problems balancing energy
and concentration. Because I have problems with
restlessness - which would be low concentration? Then I
seem to have periods where I'm drowsy. So is it a
balance of energy and concentration that I'm having a
problem with?
</p>
<p>
Achan: What do you mean, "balance of energy and
concentration"?
</p>
<p>
Marie: Well I don't know, but that's what you were
talking about last night. Restlessness is from too much
energy?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes.
</p>
<p>
Marie: I'm trying too hard, is that it?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes, yes. When you force energy too much, when
concentration is not balanced, then wandering mind has a
chance to go out, to think, because you force it. An easy
example: if you take care of two or three children, if
they are naughty, when you force them: "Stay there!
Don't do that!" you make them react and fight
with you more, right? They won't come to you. But if
you just let them play, just watch to make sure they
don't do anything dangerous, it makes them calm down.
They play, and when they're tired they just stop by
themselves.
</p>
<p>
Marie: It's hard to sit and watch restlessness without
trying to get rid of it.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You don't have to try hard. When you have the
present-moment object from rising-falling or from sitting
or another object, don't worry about restlessness. You
still feel restless but it does not bother you - it will
not prevent mindfulness from continuing, all right? It
cannot stop you from walking on the right path of
mindfulness at all. So don't care about that.
</p>
<p>
Marie: Well, I seem to have mindfulness about it but I
just need to probably not worry about it too much and just
let it go.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes, let it go.
</p>
<p>
Marie: But that's the only problem I'm having.
</p>
<p>
Achan: That's all right. Like I always say, as long as
mindfulness has an object to continue with, don't care
about the other objects [that appear]. Like when
you're moving both hands: if you focus on one hand -
the right hand or the left, it doesn't matter - you
shouldn't care about the other hand because you have
an object, one object, already. Same thing: when walking,
you have mindfulness to observe the step-by-step
experience of walking, even though you are seeing
sometimes or hearing a sound outside - but you don't
care about those other objects. You don't feel worried
or interested, you just keep going, keep walking. Even
when you see something, your attention has not been lost
[from the motion of the foot]. Okay; same thing. If you
aren't interested, or if you don't pay attention
to restlessness, there's no problem because
mindfulness keeps going with walking, all right?
</p>
<p>
Marie: Just practice.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes, just practice, just keep going. Don't
worry about something else on the side of your path. Like
when you're traveling. While you are traveling,
don't care about how beautiful the view is, or how
dangerous some place is, or how good some city is. Just
keep going according to your duty to continue. You will
pass some place that has a beautiful view, or some
dangerous place. Somewhere you'll have to climb a
mountain, somewhere there'll be a bumpy road. It
doesn't matter. Just drive the car on the middle way.
Don't take the left lane, don't take the right
lane. Middle way. Where is the end of the way? If you
don't stop, if you don't take the exit on the
right, if you don't care about looking around at both
sides of the highway and don't park at the rest area
too long - just stopping to go to the bathroom -
[laughter] then it's not too far.
</p>
<p>
Marie: Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You're welcome. How about Katy?
</p>
<p>
Katy: Well, I'm having a few difficulties in the
walking.
</p>
<p>
Achan: What difficulties?
</p>
<p>
Katy: It seems that in my mind I'm always ahead of the
next movement already.
</p>
<p>
Achan: What step you do walk?
</p>
<p>
Katy: I do five.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Oh, you do five step. So when you do five, do you
feel that mindfulness goes faster than the object?
</p>
<p>
Katy: Yes.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You need to label the object, all right? Don't
just do it. You have to go back to the label.
</p>
<p>
Katy: I do label. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: You do label. When you label, mindfulness cannot
slow down, right? [Laughs.] How do you label. . .
</p>
<p>
Katy: Um. . . do you want me to show you?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes.
</p>
<p>
Katy: All right. I can do that. So I just say,
"raising, lifting, forward, lowering and
placing" and it seems that when I have my foot down
I'm thinking already. . . it's going in my mind. .
. it seems to go too fast. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: Oh. That's all right. You just need more
practice. It doesn't mean that mindfulness is faster
than concentration. "You need more practice"
means that you are acting from habit. When placing one
foot, the other heel is up already. That's habit,
experience in daily life from the time you were born and
grew up until now. So, when you try to walk step-by-step,
when you place one foot, the other heel goes up already,
automatically. You just have to take time and practice
more.
</p>
<p>
Katy: I understand.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Don't worry that you've lost mindfulness.
When you realize, when you know that you're placing
one foot and the other heel goes up, you haven't lost
mindfulness. Mindfulness will still know this one, too,
it's just that it can't control the habit only.
How about sitting?
</p>
<p>
Katy: In the sitting I'm trying to give my mind a few
little vacations and not get angry about it, and not
really wanting for the mind to come back. . . I'm
watching it more and not getting anxious about it. . . it
feels better. I have some good sittings and some
satisfactory sittings or what I consider okay. When the
mind wanders I'm aware of it but I don't get
excited about it. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: How many steps of sitting are you doing?
</p>
<p>
Katy: I'm just doing rising and falling.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Need more. Add more steps to sitting, all right?
Because, when you just have rising and falling, it's
not enough work for mindfulness. It can give a chance for
emotion to show off during sitting, right? Just like when
you're not busy, when you don't have a job to do,
some kind of emotion can happen in your mind in the
moment. That's why you should provide more objects for
mindfulness to continue with, to keep it busy. When the
mind is busy there's no time to think about something
else, all right? Just add one more step. Peter. How about
you?
</p>
<p>
Peter: It seems to be ok. Sitting is changeable but clear,
and I'm not trying too hard and uh . . . just
rising-falling.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Do you know rising-falling automatically or do you
have to concentrate to see it?
</p>
<p>
Peter: I have to bring myself back to it regularly, but
when I've brought it back I don't have to struggle
to attend to it. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: That's correct. . . that's right. . . and
how many steps do you do?
</p>
<p>
Peter: Rising-falling, just two. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: And you don't label the word?
</p>
<p>
Peter: No.
</p>
<p>
Achan: And how long do you sit - forty minutes? [Peter
nods.] You sit forty minutes. How often do you lose
mindfulness? How many times have you lost mindfulness in
forty minutes?
</p>
<p>
Peter: I haven't stop to count [laughter]. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: [Laughing] it doesn't matter to count. Just
estimate about how often. . . more than twenty times or
something like that, or less. . .
</p>
<p>
Peter: It depends on the sitting. . . I just keep not
answering your question. . . [laughter] sometimes ten
times. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: Do you feel that sometimes it hasn't been lost
at all? Have you had an experience like this or not? That
you don't lose it at all?
</p>
<p>
Peter: Yeah sometimes, but not for forty minutes. . . I
have always lost mindfulness, you can trust me on this. .
.
</p>
<p>
Unidentified voice: He always loses it at least once.
[Laughter.]
</p>
<p>
Peter: But sometimes I'm not always attending to
rising and falling but I'm also mindful of noise and
emotion and even, sort of, second order kind of objects. .
.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes. That's not the meaning of losing
mindfulness. I ask how you feel, how often or how many
times you have lost mindfulness when sitting forty or
forty-five minutes. Even when wandering mind appears, when
you know it, you can continue or focus and forget it. Even
when some noise comes up and you know it, you can focus on
it. You can focus on noise or emotion. When you
"lose" mindfulness you know. That means it
isn't lost. You haven't lost mindfulness. If you
sit for forty minutes and you have an object all the time,
right, even if you fall asleep sometimes, you wake up and
you know; you keep going, you continue; that means you
have not lost mindfulness. Losing mindfulness means that
you feel you do not have an object to keep going. You give
a gap too long until you think, "I don't know
what objects appeared or when I lost track, when I lost
mindfulness." After you lose mindfulness you
"wake up" and wonder, "How can I return to
rising-falling? What should I begin with?" Or
something like that. You feel confused. You've lost
the way, lost the moment, all right? Is that clear or not?
</p>
<p>
Peter: I think I know what it means.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yeah, sometimes that has to happen to you.
That's the meaning of "lost." Sometimes
it's like you fall asleep, but you don't really.
But rising-falling is very subtle, very deep until you
cannot see rising-falling and you stay for awhile and wake
up and you are surprised yourself about what's wrong,
what happened, why you didn't continue observing.
That's the meaning of lost. You cannot find out the
object from moment-to-moment. Even the object is sometimes
lost. Sometimes it cannot be seen.
</p>
<p>
Peter: I don't think it's been too subtle. Never
been that deep.
</p>
<p>
Achan: I just gave an example. Someone has the experience,
when their concentration is stronger than mindfulness,
that it's easy to be lost. If you have mindfulness
always, then it isn't lost. Even if wandering mind or
some other object comes, it is the duty of mindfulness to
know and focus on it. That doesn't mean that
you've lost mindfulness. Anything else? Oh, walking?
</p>
<p>
Peter: Four steps. Goes well.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Very well, right? And you label the word?
</p>
<p>
Peter: No I'm not labeling. No - just once in awhile,
very, very lightly.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You have to go to five step; that's all right.
</p>
<p>
Peter: I think I cheated a bit last time and I was doing
five steps a little bit last walking.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You can go up; you can decide by yourself.
That's not wrong. [Laughter.] It doesn't matter to
get permission from the teacher or wait for the teacher to
give it to you. Because you have the duty to practice. If
you can continue with the next level you can go up. But if
you go up and lose mindfulness often then you can go back
to four or three step. It doesn't matter. Just
practicing.
</p>
<p>
Peter: If mindfulness feels a little weak then go back to
two or three?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes. Go back to two or three step and so change the
object. Or try standing or doing the hand motions. There
are many ways to use skillful means to make mindfulness
awake or strong. When it's weak it's like a child
who's gotten tired of a toy. When it plays too long
it's tired or bored, so you have to change to
something new to make it happy or active or bring a strong
feeling back again. Something like that, right? It's
the same with mindfulness. When you keep going with the
same object too long it makes it weak and tired.
Mindfulness wants to stop; but when you change the object
a little bit it makes it strong again.
</p>
<p>
Peter: If energy is lacking, if energy is low, you use
initial and applied thought, investigation? When energy is
low what are skillful means for helping to continue?
</p>
<p>
Achan: When energy is low right? You should stay on one
object and use labeling. Try to make concentration
stronger because it can help energy to become strong
again.
</p>
<p>
Peter: When you label?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yeah, when you label. If you're walking four or
five step go back to three or two step with the label. Or
just do rising-falling. Go back to the beginning to have
concentration first. After that, energy will come.
Anything else?
</p>
<p>
Peter: Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Achan: All right; Ron.
</p>
<p>
Ron: I was just very restless earlier during the day, lost
in a lot of thought. And after lunch I sat for a longer
period of time and, like Peter, I didn't stay with the
breath. I don't stay with the rise and fall very long
. . . but it's more interesting when other things
happened like sound or thought . . . and I follow
what's happening there but I get lost most of the time
. . . I come back to the breath eventually but I find that
the secondary objects are much easier.
</p>
<p>
Achan: That's all right. If you know there is
restlessness or if you know the mind is wandering to see
some object outside and can come back, back and forth,
that's all right.
</p>
<p>
Ron: The breath isn't really clear.
</p>
<p>
Achan: That means you need concentration. When mindfulness
cannot stay in the moment-to-moment with the breath, you
can get many, many objects around you. But if
concentration is strong it works with mindfulness to make
the object very clear. And if you go back to the breath,
that will be very clear, too. When mindfulness observes
some object outside [such as a sound, sight, etc.] and
then goes back to the main object [rising-falling,
posture, movement of the foot, and so on], if it's not
quite clear, that means that concentration is not quite
balanced yet. If it's balanced, then it will be
equally clear whether you're observing an object
outside or rising-falling. That's to test how
concentration can work with mindfulness or balance with
mindfulness or not. You have to know - when you jump to
this object to that object or that moment [i.e., jumping
from one "outside" object to another] until
nothing else appears and you go back to here
[rising-falling], if it's not quite clear, then that
means you have to practice more. You need more time to
continue and it will adjust or balance after that. All
right. That's good. Lisa.
</p>
<p>
Lisa: Very good, Achan. You're getting better
[referring to his pronunciation]. Since I talked to you
yesterday and had some instruction from you, my
mindfulness on the rising-falling of the abdomen is much
easier, not so difficult. And I'm not fighting with
myself, not giving myself mental slaps for going away.
I'm being easier on myself. The walking: I'm doing
four steps and labeling each step. And sometimes I feel
that I want to add another step. So I think I need to go
to one more step next time I walk. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: Now you walk four step, right?
</p>
<p>
Unidentified voice: She keeps wanting to put in
"intending" before the step. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: That's uh. . . just greed! [laughter.]
</p>
<p>
Lisa: That's me. . . wanting, wanting, wanting. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: Desire. Don't follow it, don't follow
desire, don't follow greed, all right? Because greed
never stops. It never fills up. That's why - if the
body needs food, we have to eat. But if the mind is hungry
- don't eat, because the mind is never full. It's
the same thing. You want to get more steps, want to get
something more, want to be successful or something like
that. That's desire. Don't follow it. Don't
listen. Don't want, don't need that. If you keep
practicing four steps and it's very clear, if you can
make it clear, not just if you can focus, but have to see
clearly about arising and passing away, to see that each
step is impermanence, suffering or nonself. . . if you can
make it more clear until you feel bored sometimes, or
afraid or sad or happy with seeing clearly, that's
correct. . . that will mean very sharp knowledge with the
moment-to-moment experience of each step. Even if someone
keeps practicing two or three step, if he can see the
truth of impermanence, suffering and nonself clearly, then
it's not important to go up to four or five or six
step because the mind is balanced with knowledge.
Something like that. I mean, you don't have to need
more. Just practice until what you're doing is clear
from the level you're at until you can end doubt in
your mind. "Oh, I see that! Oh, I don't feel
confused!" Or, "I don't have doubt anymore
from the truth I see now." Something like that. If
you don't see clearly, you'll still have doubt in
your mind. You want to see the next step, to find out if
it is the same as this step or not. You want to see
something else, to see if it is different or the same.
That means doubt, you see? [If one could see the present
experience clearly, one would have no desire to see
anything further. There would be no need for
clarification.] Try to practice on the level you are at
now, from moment-to-moment, until you see clearly, until
you make sure about that level first. After that I will
know how to give you more objects, all right? Anything
else? That's good, that's good. Just keep going.
Don't care about five step or six step. Enlightenment
doesn't come from five or six step! It comes from
seeing clearly. You'll destroy doubt in your mind only
by doing it correctly. The step-by-step technique is just
for practicing, for balancing for someone. If a meditator
is up and down, if energy, concentration and mindfulness
are not balanced, then the person should practice the
step-by-step technique, back and forth. If someone is
balanced enough, he can just keep focusing in the moment.
It doesn't matter how many steps. No big deal, all
right? Not a big deal about that. That's why, just try
to keep going or continue. Ok . . . Elaine - sleepy
always! [Laughs.]
</p>
<p>
Elaine: Well, I feel the walking is going well. I'm
doing five steps. And I can be quite focused on that and I
haven't been labeling. But when I come to sit it
isn't clear, it isn't focused and . . . I
don't feel that I'm concentrated. I'm doing
the rising-falling and sitting and I'm having to find
that I have to label that just to keep awake. Otherwise
even if I stray a little bit I'm nodding off and
I'm sleeping or sleepy. . . Well it's quite a
struggle and that's what I find so strange. The
walking can be quite clear but the sitting is just the
opposite. So I was doing more walking because I thought
that maybe that would carry over into my sitting but it
doesn't seem to matter.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You say the sitting is not quite clear. . .
</p>
<p>
Elaine: Well, I guess I'm comparing it to the way it
is sometimes when you're quite concentrated on your
breathing and your mind doesn't wander very much and
you don't even have to label the breathing, it's
just there, and your mind's just watching it and it
doesn't seem to be very difficult. Whereas, today it
just isn't as concentrated or I'm just not. . .
it's a struggle to be watching your breath and
watching it closely. . . is it okay the way it is or is
there something I should be doing to make the sitting more
concentrated? I feel like I'm sleepy.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You're asking whether, when you feel sleepy,
you need to set up more concentration? Sure. Try to go
back to label the object with mental notes or try to wake
mindfulness up. Mindfulness needs support to focus on
sleepiness. Have to put energy to do and have to label the
word to make concentration and energy stronger. That can
help mindfulness focus on sleepiness. If mindfulness
isn't strong enough, you have to change position, have
to walk. You don't have to stay in the group, all
right? In case mindfulness cannot focus on the object
"sleepiness," or isn't strong enough to stay
with the object, not just sleepiness - wandering mind or
some strong emotion - if these are stronger than
mindfulness, you don't need to stay in the same
posture. You don't need to stay with one posture or
one object; you have to change to another object. You have
to walk; if that doesn't help, if you're still
drowsy, you can try to walk faster. Use clear
comprehension to observe while you walk faster. After that
you can return to the moment-to-moment technique.
That's all right. But even when the object is stronger
than mindfulness, mindfulness is still there, it's not
totally lost; it just cannot keep observing from
moment-to-moment.
