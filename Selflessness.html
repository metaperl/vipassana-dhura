<p class="hd">Selflessness (Anattaa)</p>

<p>More
and more the noble teaching of the Buddha seems
to be on the way to conquer the world. More than ever before, Buddhists
are
working for its propagation in nearly all the countries of the earth.
Especially
in India, the birth place of Buddhism
(from where it disappeared for nearly a thousand years), Buddhism has
again made its entrance and gained a firm footing, and with rapid
strides it is
gaining more and more ground. One therefore should rather think it a
good omen
that India, having regained its independence, has adopted as its emblem
the Buddhist Four-Lion symbol of Emperor Asoka, and that, at the
proclamation
of the Indian Republic there
appeared the Buddha's statue (behind the presidential throne,
crowned with this
Buddhist emblem).</p>

<p>Also
all over Europe and America a mighty Buddhist
wave is set in motion, which no longer can be kept back and suppressed,
and which,
sooner or later, will flood the world with its beneficial influence.
The world
is no longer satisfied with dogmas based on blind belief. Everywhere in
the
world there is found today a striving for freedom and independence,
externally
and internally. And ever
more the thinking man feels that the destinies of beings are not
dependent on
the omnipotence and infinite goodness of an imaginary creator, but that
they
rest entirely on the beings themselves. It is in Buddhism that one may
find the
true answers to many of the problems that are troubling men, and which
they
wish to have solved.
Everybody knows that Buddhism is not a revealed religion and not based
on blind
belief, but is a doctrine to be realized by man's own
understanding (a doctrine that
makes man free and independent in his thinking, and assures him of
happiness
and peace).</p>

<p>But
of one thing I wish to warn
all those who are working for the propagation of Buddhism: not to allow
themselves to be influenced or carried away by seemingly, or (what is
still worse) materialistic teachings. For all
these
are, in essence and substance, very often
diametrically opposed to the Buddha's doctrines,and
prevent a real understanding and realization of the profound law
discovered and proclaimed by the Buddha.
</p>

<p>The
most crucial point for most
men seems to be the Buddha's fundamental teaching of
phenomenality, selflessness
and impersonality of existence
(in
Pali <i>anattaa</i>).
It is the middle way between two
extremes: on the one hand, the spiritualistic belief in an eternal
ego-entity, or soul, outlasting
death; on the other hand, the materialistic belief in a temporary
ego-entity becoming annihilated
at death.</p>

<p>Therefore
it is said: There are
three teachers in the world. The first teacher teaches the existence of
an
eternal ego-entity outlasting death: that is the Eternalist (as for
example the Christian).The second teacher teaches a temporary
ego-entity which becomes
annihilated at death: that is the annihilationist , or
materialist. The third teacher teaches neither an eternal, nor a
temporary ego-entity: this is the Buddha. The Buddha teaches that what
we call
ego, self, soul, personality, etc. are merely conventional terms not
referring to any real independent
entity. And he teaches that there is only to be found this
psycho-physical process
of existence changing from moment to moment. Without understanding the
selflessness
of existence, it is not possible to gain a real understanding of the
Buddha-word. And it is not possible without it to realize that goal of
emancipation and
deliverance of mind proclaimed by the Buddha. This doctrine of
selflessness of
existence forms the essence of the Buddha's doctrine of
emancipation. Thus with
this doctrine of selflessness, or anattaa<i>, </i>stands
and falls the entire Buddhist structure. Indeed,
for anyone who
wishes to engage in the study of the Buddhist scriptures, the best
thing would
be, from the very start, to get himself acquainted with the two methods
in
which the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the world. The first method is
the
teaching in conventional language; the second method is the teaching in
philosophically correct language. The first one relates to conventional
truth, <i>vohaara-sacca, </i> the
second, to truth in the ultimate sense, <i>paramattha-sacca.
</i></p>

<p>Thus,
whenever the Buddha uses
such terms as I, person, living being, etc., this is to be understood
as conventional
speech, and thus not correct in the highest sense <i>(paramattha-vacana).
</i> It is similar to  speaking
of the rising and setting of the sun, though we know thoroughly
well that this does not correspond to reality. Thus the Buddha teaches
that, in
the ultimate sense, amongst all these psychophysical phenomena of
existence
there cannot be found any eternal or even temporary
ego-entity, and hence that all
existence of whatever kind is something impersonal
(or anattaa).
</p>

<p>In
this connection I would like to
emphasize the fact that this fundamental doctrine of selflessness and
emptiness
is not ( as some misinformed Western Buddhists assert)only
taught in the southern school of Buddhism, but that even in the
so-called Mahayana schools it forms a most essential
part. Without this teaching of anattaa (or egolessness), there
is no Buddhism; and without having realized the truth of egolessnessno real
progress is possible on the path to deliverance.
</p>

<p>The
Buddha is, in every respect, a
teacher of the golden mean, ethically as well as philosophically. From
the
ethical standpoint, for example, the Buddha rejects two extremes: the
way of
sensual pleasures and the way of self-torture. From the philosophical
standpoint
he rejects eternity, as well as the
temporary nature of an ego-entity. Just so he
rejects belief in an absolute identity and an absolute otherness of the
various
stages of the process of existence. He rejects determinism, as well as
the
belief in chance. He rejects the belief in absolute existence and
absolute
non-existence, in freedom of will, as well as in non-freedom of will.
</p>

<p>All
these things will become clear
to one who understands the selflessness and conditioned nature of all
phenomena
of existence. On the understanding of these two truths depends the
understanding of the entire doctrine of the Buddha. Hence the
understanding and
final penetration of selflessness and conditionedness of all
phenomena of
existence are the necessary foundation to the realization of the noble
eightfold path leading to deliverance from all vanity and misery: right
understanding, right thought, right speech, right bodily action, right
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration of
mind. Only this golden middle path, based on these two kinds of right
understanding, namely of "selflessness and
conditionedness," can alleviate and
destroy these vain illusions of "self" and craving,
which are the root-causes
of all war and bloodshed in the world. But without these two kinds of
understanding there is no realization of the holy and peaceful goal
pointed out
by the Buddha. There are, however, various would-be Buddhists in the
West who
are attached to an imaginary Great Self; who
uphold that the Buddha did in no way reject
the view of an "eternal Atman," or soul, behind and
independent of the
phenomena of existence; and who believe that the Mahayana
texts teach such a doctrine. Such assertions, however, do not in the
least prove correct, for neither the Pali texts, nor the early Mahayana
texts,From
a study of the Buddhist scriptures, any reader, unbiased in mind and
free from prejudices, will never
from a study of the Buddhist scriptures
come to the conclusion that the Buddha ever taught any such ego-entity
within
or outside the corporeal, mental and spiritual phenomena of existence.
Nowhere
in the world can there be found such an entity, as was clearly pointed
out by
the Buddha. </p>

<p>Regarding
the questions whether
the Holy One will continue after death, or not continue etc., the
Buddha says that all such
questions are wrongly put. And why? Because what is called the
"Holy One" is
here only a conventional term and refers to no real entity, a process
of corporeal, mental and spiritual phenomena. In another text,
the Buddha asks a monk whether he considered corporeality as the Holy
One (Tathaagata) , or feelings, or perceptions, or mental
formations, or consciousness.Or
whether he believed the Holy One to exist within these five groups
of phenomena or outside of
them. 
Or whether all these phenomena heaped together were the
Holy One. And denying all these questions, the Buddha further said
that, even
during a lifetime, the Holy One could not be discovered in reality.
Therefore 
it would be wrong to ask whether the Holy One will continue or not
continue after death, etc. Thus, no entities are existing in the world,
but
only ever-changing processes. The Buddha further says: Becauseman does
not understand that  corporeality,
feeling and the other mental and
spiritual phenomena are impermanent, unsatisfactory and
impersonal <i>(</i>aniccaa<i> , dukkha,
</i>and <i> anattaa), </i>
does not understand their
conditioned origin, their extinction, and the path leading to their
extinction,
he therefore will think that the Holy One does continue, or does not
continue after
death,why the Buddha did not answer such
questions.</p>

<p>According
to Buddhism, the whole of existence is
comprised of the
five groups of phenomena mentioned above, or more briefly still,
expressed in
three groups: corporeality, consciousness
and the mental factors. And within these three groups are
comprised the only and ultimate things given, though also these again
are mere
fleeting and evanescent phenomena, flashing up for a moment, in order
to
disappear immediately thereafter forever.
Thus whenever in the Buddhist scriptures mention is made of I, self,
living
being, etc. (even
of the Buddha),
these expressions accordingly are used merely as conventional terms,
without
referring to any real entities. Therefore the Buddha has said,
"It is
impossible, it cannot be that a man with real understanding should ever
consider anything as a real entity."</p>

<p>He
who does not understand the selflessness of
existence, and who is still attached to self-illusion, one cannot
comprehend
and understand the four Noble Truths of the Buddha in the true light.
</p>

<p>These
four truths are:</p>

<p>the
truth of the
impermanency, unsatisfactoriness and impersonality of existence;</p>

<p>the
truth that
repeated rebirth and misery are rooted in self-illusion and craving for
existence;
</p>

<p>the
truth that
through the extinction of all self-illusion, vanity and craving,
deliverance
from all rebirth will be attained;
and</p>

<p>the
truth that the
eightfold path,
based on right understanding,
is the path leading to this goal.</p>

<p>He
who has not penetrated the ego-illusion and is
still attached to self-vanity
will believe that it is he himself that suffers, that it is he himself
that performs the good and evil deeds leading to his rebirth, that it
is he
himself that will enter&nbsp; Nibbaana,
that
it is he himself that will bring the eightfold path to perfection.
</p>

<p>One
who,
however, has fully penetrated the selflessness of existence, knows
that, in the
highest sense, there is no individual that suffers, that
commits the kammic
deeds, that enters Nibbaana, and that brings the Eightfold Path to
perfection.
In the <i>Visuddhimagga </i>it is
therefore
said:</p>

<p>Mere
suffering exists, no sufferer is found.</p>

<p>The
deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Nibbaana
is, but not the man that enters it.</p>

<p>The
path is, but no traveller on it is seen. </p>

<p>Further:
</p>

<p>No
doer of the deeds is found,</p>

<p>No
being that may reap their fruits. </p>

<p>Empty
phenomena roll on!</p>

<p>This
is the only right view.</p>

<p>Therefore,
wherever the doctrine of the selflessness of
all existence is rejected, the
Buddha's word is rejected, But wherever, through penetration
of the
selflessness of all existence, the ego-vanity has reached ultimate
extinction,
there the goal of the Buddha's teaching has been realized:
freedom from all
vanity of I and Mine, and
the highest peace of Nibbaana.</p>



<p>Extracts
from the Sa.myutta-Nikaaya on selflessness </p>



<p>SN
5:10</p>

<p>When
certain things we find are combined, </p>

<p>We
speak of 'chariot,' speak of
'car.' </p>

<p>Just
so when all Five Groups appear, </p>

<p>We
use the designation 'man.'</p>

<p>'Tis
naught but woe that does arise, </p>

<p>And
that exists and passes off. </p>

<p>Nothing
but suffering appears, </p>

<p>Nothing
but woe that vanishes.</p>

<p>The
'five groups' are a classification, in which the
Buddha has summed up all the physical and mental phenomena of
existence, and in
particular, those which appear to the ignorant man as his self or
personality.
They are: corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations, and
consciousness. </p>

<p>It
is said in the <i>Visuddhimagga: </i>
</p>

<p>"Whenever
different parts, as axle, wheels, frame,
pole, etc., are combined in a certain manner, we use the conventional
designation 'chariot.' But if we examine one part
after the other, we cannot,
in the ultimate sense, discover anything that can be called a chariot.
It is
likewise with the five groups of existence <i>(khandha). </i>If
they are present, one
uses the conventional designation 'being' or
'personality,' etc. But if we
examine each phenomenon in its ultimate sense, there is nothing that
can form a
basis for such conceptions as 'I am' and
'I' Hence, in the ultimate sense, only
mental and physical phenomena exist."</p>

<p>SN
12:12</p>

<p>"Through
sense-impression is conditioned feeling-thus
it is said in the formula of dependent origination <i>(pa.ticca-samuppaada). </i>
</p>

<p>"But
who, Venerable One, is it that feels?"
</p>

<p>"This
question is not proper," said the Exalted One.
"I do not teach that there is one who feels. If however the
question is put
thus: 'Conditioned through what, does feeling
arise?' then the right answer
will be: 'Through sense-impression is feeling
conditioned... ; through feeling,
craving; through craving, clinging;...' "
</p>

<p>SN
12:35</p>

<p>But
what are old age and death, and to whom do they
belong? I do not teach that there is one thing called old age and
death, and
that there is someone to whom they belong. Verily if one holds the view
that
life (<i>jiiva</i>: life principle, soul,
etc.) is identical with the body, in that case there can be no holy
life. And
if one holds the view that life is one thing but body another thing,
also in
that case a holy life is impossible. Avoiding both these
extremes (i.e.
complete identity and complete otherness), the Perfect One has taught
the
doctrine that lies in the middle, namely: 'through rebirth
conditioned are old
age and death; ... through the (karmical) process of becoming,
rebirth; ... through
clinging the process of becoming ... through craving,
clinging, ... through
feeling, craving; ... etc...
</p>

<p>The
<i>Visuddhimagga</i>
quotes:</p>

<p>"From
woe and sorrow springs delusive thinking, </p>

<p>No
first beginning of existence can be seen.</p>

<p>No
doer can be found, nor one that reaps the fruits.
</p>

<p>And
twelve fold empty is the cycle of rebirth,</p>

<p>And
steadily the wheel of life rolls on and on."
</p>

<p>SN
12:61</p>

<p>Better
it would be to consider the body as the 'self,'
rather than the mind. And why? Because this body may last for 10, 20,
30, 40 or
50 years, even for 100 years and more. But that which is called
'mind,
consciousness, thinking,' arises continuously, during day and
night, as one
thing, and as something different again it vanishes.</p>

<p>Now, here the learned and noble disciple considers
thoroughly the dependent origination: 'If this is,
then that becomes. Through
the arising of this, that comes to arise; through the extinction of
this, that
becomes extinguished, namely: Through ignorance conditioned
arise the
kamma-formations; through the kamma-formations, consciousness
(in next life);
through consciousness, corporeality, and mind; ... through the
extinction of
ignorance the kamma-formations become extinguished; through the
extinction of
the kamma-formations, consciousness... etc.'
</p>

<p>SN
22:9-11</p>

<p>Corporeality
... feeling ... perception ... mental
formations
... and consciousness are impermanent ... woeful
... selfless, be they of the past or
the future, not to mention the present. Understanding thus, the learned
and
noble disciple does no longer cling to things past, and he enters the
path
leading to the turning away therefrom, to detachment and extinction.
</p>

<p>SN
22:18-20</p>

<p>The
five Groups of Existence are impermanent, woeful
and selfless. And also the causes and conditions of the arising of
these groups
of existence are impermanent, woeful and selfless. How could that which
has
arisen through something impermanent, woeful and selfless as
its root, be
itself permanent, joyful, and a self?</p>

<p>SN
22:47</p>

<p>All
those ascetics and priests, who again and again in
manifold ways believe in an 'self' (<i>attaa</i>),
they all do so with regard to the five groups of existence, or to one
of them
namely:</p>

<p>There
the ignorant worldling ... considers one of the
five groups as the self; or the self as the owner of that group, or
that group
as included in the self, or the self as included in that group.
</p>

<p>SN
22:81</p>

<p>Now,
someone holds the view: This is my 'self,' this
is the world. After death I shall remain permanent, steady, eternal,
and not be
subject to any change.</p>

<p>This
eternity-view is one kamma-formation <i>(sa.nkhaara).</i> But through what
is this kamma-formation conditioned? </p>

<p>It
is the craving which has arisen in the ignorant
worldling while being impressed by a feeling conditioned through an
infatuated
sense-impression. It is through this craving <i>(ta.nhaa) </i>arisen
hereby,
that the kamma-formation has arisen. Hence that kamma-formation is
impermanent,
created, and has conditionally arisen. In one who thus understands,
thus sees
the immediate extinction of biases <i>(aasava) </i>takes
place. Again, someone
holds the view: 'May I not be! May there nothing belong to
me! I shall not be!
Nothing will belong to me!' Also this annihilation-view is a
kamma-formation ...
is impermanent, created and conditionally arisen. In one who thus
understands,
thus sees, the immediate extinction of biases takes place.
</p>

<p>SN
22:85</p>

<p>To
the monk Yamaka once the following wrong view had
arisen: 'Thus do I understand the doctrine shown by the
Blessed One that he in
whom all Biases have vanished, at the dissolution of the body, after
death,
will become annihilated and will no longer exist after
death.' (Saariputta:)
"What do you think, Brother Yamaka, are corporeality
... feeling ... perception ...
mental formations ... or Consciousness permanent or
impermanent?"</p>

<p>"Impermanent,
Venerable Sir."...</p>

<p>"Now,
do you consider corporeality etc. as the Perfect
One?" "No, Venerable Sir."
</p>

<p>"Or
do you consider the Perfect One as contained
therein?" "No, Venerable Sir."
</p>

<p>"Or
do you consider all these groups combined as the
Perfect One?"</p>

<p>"No,
Venerable Sir."</p>

<p>"Or
do you think that the Perfect One is without corporeality,
or without feeling, without perception, without mental formations,
without
consciousness?"</p>

<p>"No,
Venerable Sir."</p>

<p>"Now,
since you cannot, even during life-time, make
out the Perfect One according to truth and reality, how can you rightly
maintain that the Perfect One will, at the dissolution of the body
become
annihilated and no longer continue after death?</p>

<p>"Should
someone ask me, what will become of the Holy
One, I
should answer thus: 'Corporeality, feeling, perception,
mental formations, and
consciousness are impermanent and what is impermanent, that is woeful;
and what
is woeful, that will become extinguished and
annihilated.'"</p>

<p>Hence,
it is only these five groups of phenomena embracing all existence
whatever,
which are here to be considered, while the designations
'Perfect One,' I, Ego,
self, person, man, animal etc. are merely conventional terms, not
referring to
any real entities. And the so-called pure 'self' is
merely a metaphysical
fiction or hypothesis.</p>

<p>SN
22:89</p>

<p>Five
Groups of Existence forming the objects of
attachment' <i>(upaadaanakkhandha)
</i>have been
taught
by the Blessed One: corporeality, feeling, perception, mental
formations,
consciousness.</p>

<p>With
regard to these five groups I do not find any self <i>(atta),
</i>or something 'belonging to a self' <i>(attaniya), </i>but still I am not yet a
Holy One, not yet freed from
biases. Also concerning these groups of existence liable to attachment,
I am no
longer subject to the thoughts of 'I am' or
'This I am'. </p>

<p>SN
22:90</p>

<p>The
world, as a rule, is fettered by attachment and
clinging to things, and is firmly adhering to them. But the learned and
noble
disciple does no longer attach himself, cling and firmly adhere and
incline to
the thoughts: 'I have a self (atta)' and he knows:
'Merely woe is it that
arises, merely woe that vanishes.'</p>

<p>SN
22:95</p>

<p>Suppose
a man who is not blind, beheld the many
bubbles on the Ganges as they drive along; and he watched them, and
carefully
examined them. After carefully examining them, they will appear to him
empty,
unreal and unsubstantial. In exactly the same way does the monk behold
all
corporeal phenomena, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and
states of
consciousness, whether past, present or future, one's own or
external, gross or
subtle, lofty or low, far or near. And he watches them, and examines
them
carefully; and after carefully examining them, they appear to him
empty, unreal
and unsubstantial.</p>

<p>The
body's like a lump of foam, </p>

<p>Feeling
like a water-bubble, </p>

<p>Perception
like a void mirage, </p>

<p>Formations
like a plantain tree, </p>

<p>And
consciousness like jugglery.</p>

<p>SN
22:96</p>

<p>There
is no corporeality, no feeling, no perception,
no mental formations, no consciousness that is permanent,
enduring and
lasting, and that, not subject to any change, will eternally remain the
same.
If there existed such a self that is permanent, enduring and lasting
and not
subject to any change, then holy life leading to complete extinction of
suffering
will not be possible.</p>

<p>SN
22:102</p>

<p>Once
the contemplation of impermanency has been developed
and has attained full growth then it will overcome all craving for
sensuous
existence, all craving for fine-material existence, all craving for
immaterial existence; it will overcome and uproot
all conceit of 'I am.'</p>

<p>Only
on reaching perfect Holiness, all conceit of 'I
am' (asmimaana)
will forever disappear.</p>

<p>SN
22:117</p>

<p>The
learned and noble disciple does not consider corporeality,
feeling, perception, mental formations or consciousness as the self;
nor the
self as the owner of one of these groups, nor this group as included
within the
self, nor the self as included within this group.
</p>

<p>Of
such a learned and noble disciple it is said that
he is no longer fettered by any group of existence, own or external:
thus I
say.</p>

<p>SN
22:122</p>

<p>...
It is possible that a virtuous man, while
contemplating the five groups of existence as impermanent,
woeful... empty,
selfless, may realize the fruit of stream-entrance...
</p>

<p>SN
22:147f
</p>

<p>The
noble disciple who out of faith has gone forth from
home to the homeless life, has with regard to the five groups of
existence to
fulfil the task of living in contemplation of their impermanency,
woefulness,
and selflessness. And while penetrating these things, he becomes freed
therefrom, freed from rebirth, old age and death, from sorrow,
lamentation,
grief and despair, becomes freed from suffering: thus I say.

SN 22:47 it was stated, in a more general way, that
any kind of self-illusion is necessarily based upon the five groups of
existence.
Here, however, the same is said with special reference to the
eternity-views.</p>

<p>SN
35:6</p>

<p>The
visible <i>objects </i>are
selfless (<i>anattaa</i>); sounds, odours,
tastes, bodily
impressions and mind-objects are selfless. But of that which is
selfless, one
has, according to reality and true wisdom, to know thus:
'That am I not, that
does not belong to me, that is not my self'...
</p>

<p>SN
35:23</p>

<p>What
is the totality of things?</p>

<p>Eye
and visible objects, ear and sounds, nose and
odours, tongue and tastes, body and bodily impressions, mind and
mind-objects:
these are called the totality of things.</p>

<p>SN
35:45-49</p>

<p>All
things are ego-less. All things one has to
comprehend fully (1<sup>st</sup> truth), all things one has
to overcome (2<sup>nd</sup>
truth), all things one has to know directly...
</p>

<p>SN
35:85</p>

<p>It
is said that the world is empty. But why does one
call the world empty?</p>

<p>Because
the world is empty of a self (<i>attaa</i>)
and of something belonging to a
self (<i>attaniya</i>), therefore the world
is called empty. But which are the things that are empty of a self?
</p>

<p>Empty
of a self are eye and visible objects, ear and
sounds, nose and odours, tongue and tastes, body and bodily
impressions, mind
and mind-objects.</p>

<p>SN
35:90</p>

<p>One
should not imagine oneself being identical with
the eye, should not imagine oneself being included within the eye,
should not
imagine oneself being outside the eye, should not imagine oneself:
'The eye
belongs to me.'</p>

<p>One
should not imagine oneself being identical with
the visible objects, should not imagine oneself being included within
the
visible objects, should not imagine oneself being outside the visible
objects,
should not imagine: 'Visible objects belong to me. One should
not imagine
oneself being identical with eye-consciousness, should not imagine
oneself
being included within eye-consciousness, should not imagine
oneself being
outside of eye-consciousness, should not imagine: 'The
eye-consciousness
belongs to me.' ...</p>

<p>One
should not imagine oneself being identical with
the totality of things....</p>

<p>Thus
not imagining any more, the wise disciple clings
no longer to anything in the world. Clinging no longer to anything, he
trembles
not. Trembling no longer, he reaches in his own person the extinction
of all
vanity: 'Exhausted is rebirth, lived the holy life; and no
further existence
have I to expect." Thus he
knows.
</p>

<p>The
four types of 'imagining' mentioned in the first
paragraph of this text, correspond to those contained in the 1<sup>st</sup>
Discourse of the Majjhima-Nikaaya (Muulapariyaaya Sutta).
</p>

<p>SN
35:141</p>

<p>...
Consciousness (mind) is selfless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also the causes and conditions of the
arising of consciousness, they likewise are selfless. For, how could it
be
possible that consciousness having arisen through something which is
selfless,
could ever be a self?...</p>

<p>SN
35:163</p>

<p>...
Whosoever understands and contemplates the mind as
selfless, in him the self-view disappears. Whoso understands and
contemplates
as selfless (<i>anattaa</i>) the
mind-objects ... , mind-consciousness ...
mind-impression ... and the agreeable and
disagreeable and indifferent feeling conditioned through
mind-impression, in
him the self-view disappears ...</p>

<p>SN
35:193</p>

<p>...
Just as this body has in various ways been revealed,
disclosed and explained as selfless, in exactly the same way one should
explain
also mind as selfless ...</p>

<p>SN
35:197</p>

<p>...
'Empty village' is a name for the six sense-organs;
Thus, whenever an experienced, learned and wise man examines
the six
sense-organs, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind-organ, then all
these things
appear to him as delusive, empty, and deceitful...
</p>

<p>SN
35:207</p>

<p>...
'I am' is a delusion. 'This I
am' is a delusion. 'I
shall be' is a delusion. 'I shall not be'
is a delusion. 'Corporeal shall I
be' is a delusion. 'Incorporeal shall I
be' is a delusion. 'Endowed with
perception shall I be' is a delusion, 'Without
perception shall I be' is a
delusion. 'Neither with nor without perception shall I
be,' is a delusion.
Delusion is a sickness, an ulcer, a thorn.</p>

<p>SN
41:7</p>

<p>...
What is the mind-deliverance of emptiness (<i>su.t.tata</i>)?
There the monk repairs to
the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an
empty hut. And he contemplates thus: 'Empty is all this of a
self and of
anything belonging to a self' ...
</p>

<p>SN
46:72f</p>

<p>...
If one develops the contemplation of impermanency,
the contemplation of woefulness due to impermanency, the contemplation
of
selflessness due to woefulness, then all these contemplations are
leading to
high blessing. ...</p>

<p>SN
56:8</p>

<p>Do not think such evil,
unwholesome thoughts, as 'Life
and body are identical'; or 'Life is one thing, but
another is the body'; or
'Does
the Perfect One live after death?' 'Or
not?' ... And why should one not think
such thoughts? Because such thoughts are not profitable, do not belong
to the
genuine holy life, do not lead to the turning away and
detachment, not to
extinction, appeasement, enlightenment, and Nibbaana.</p>
