                <div class="line">&nbsp;</div>

                <p>This article offers step-by-step instructions for nine insight meditation exercises, as well as a
                    detailed explanation of mindful eating, hints on dealing with problems such as wandering mind,
                    sleepiness, disturbing mental images, unpleasant emotions, and more.</p>

                <p>The following exercises are not necessarily listed in order of difficulty. Exercises suitable for
                    beginners are noted. We generally recommend beginners start with the rising and falling or hand
                    motions exercise. Basic walking meditation is also appropriate for beginners.</p>

                <p>To start, choose one or two exercises and practice them <em>daily</em>. Even after you gain more
                    experience, you don't have to do all the exercises. Practicing just one exercise consistently is
                    more important.</p>

                <p>If there's something you don't understand at first, please don't let that daunt you. Although
                    vipassana is a very simple method, many aspects of meditation only become clear by actually doing
                    it. The best way to understand is to practice the exercises.</p>

                <p>Although these Buddhist meditation exercises come from the traditions of the Burmese teacher Mahasi
                    Sayadaw and the Thai teacher Chao Khun Bhavanapirama Thera, you don't have to be a Buddhist to
                    practice them. Vipassana is a non-secular method.</p>

                <p>[Note: This information is not meant to substitute for the guidance of a qualified instructor. Anyone
                    serious about insight meditation should eventually find a teacher who can offer individualized
                    counsel. In order to better understand some of the ideas presented here we recommend reading the
                    link: <a href="whatisvipassana.htm">What is Vipassana?</a>]</p>

                <div class="line">&nbsp;</div>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">A Suitable Place</a></p>

                <p>Find a place where you can sit comfortably, without interruptions, for at least ten minutes. Although
                    complete silence isn't necessary&mdash;or even desirable&mdash;for insight meditation, the room
                    should be free of obtrusive noises such as music, television, constantly-ringing phones, and nearby
                    conversations. Even quiet talk can distract you because the mind will try to understand the
                    words.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, background noises like the sound of traffic, the bark of a dog or a ticking clock
                    should not be considered hindrances, and in fact can be legitimate objects of mindfulness. Don't
                    wear earplugs in an attempt to "soundproof" your practice.</p>

                <p>If you meditate in the bedroom it's better to sit on the floor instead of the bed, which may cause
                    sleepiness. (If you are ill or disabled, however, it is fine to practice in bed). Your sitting
                    meditation space doesn't have to be large. Even a walk-in closet will do.</p>

                <div class="line">&nbsp;</div>

                <a name="b"></a>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Clothing</a></p>

                <p>Wear loose clothing if possible, and remove your shoes. Sometimes you might want to practice away
                    from home (at the office, perhaps) and you won't be able to change clothes. But as long as you have
                    privacy you can loosen your belt, remove your jacket and footwear, and find a comfortable place to
                    sit.</p>

                <div class="line">&nbsp;</div>

                <a name="c"></a>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Sitting Styles</a></p>

                <p>The following postures are suitable for sitting meditation: 1. Half lotus; 2. Full lotus; 3.
                    Cross-legged tailor fashion; 4. Legs bent with one leg in front (Burmese style); 5. Kneeling on a
                    meditation bench; 6. Sitting in a chair.</p>

                <p>The first pose, half lotus, is the one most often seen in the Buddha statues of Southeast Asia. The
                    legs are crossed and the right foot rests on the left thigh. This position is appropriate for most
                    meditators. The next pose, full lotus, is only practical if you are very flexible. The right foot
                    rests on the left thigh, the left foot on the right thigh.</p>

                <p>Tailor fashion is less stable but easier than half lotus. Easiest of all the floor positions is the
                    Burmese pose in which the legs are bent but not crossed. One leg lies in front of or "outside" the
                    other. Both legs rest on the floor but don't touch each other. If these postures are too difficult
                    you can sit on a chair or a meditation bench.</p>

                <p>When using a chair, keep your feet flat on the ground and try not to let your back touch the chair.
                    If you need to change posture because of discomfort, do so slowly and mindfully, observing the
                    intention to move before shifting the body. Whatever pose you choose should be comfortable enough
                    that you can maintain it without moving for at least twenty minutes (unless you're practicing for a
                    shorter time, of course).</p>

                <p>When sitting on the floor it will help to use a cushion. The cushion should be firm enough that it
                    won't be compressed flat when sat on. The ideal thickness is somewhere between two and six inches.
                    You'll want to experiment and find out what works best for you. Place the cushion under your
                    buttocks with your legs touching the floor. The legs should not rest on the cushion. Elevating the
                    hips takes stress off the neck and back vertebrae and aligns the spine, which allows you to sit
                    comfortably for longer periods.</p>

                <p>Regardless of which position you choose, don't let your back slump too much. On the other hand, you
                    shouldn't sit so straight that you tense the body. Mind and body should feel relaxed, yet alert.
                    Striking the right balance between the two extremes will take some experimenting. Think of tuning a
                    guitar string: it should be just right&mdash;neither too tight nor too loose.</p>

                <p>Having found a comfortable position, put your hands in your lap, one on top of the other, with the
                    palms facing upward. Traditionally the back of the right hand rests on top of the left palm. Don't
                    clench your hands. In all the exercises except walking meditation your eyes can be either open or
                    closed (in walking meditation your eyes must be open).</p>

                <p>We advise beginners to close their eyes, which allows for easier concentration. But sometimes
                    concentration becomes stronger than mindfulness. In that case opening the eyes may help disperse the
                    excess concentration and bring the two factors into balance again. Only momentary concentration is
                    needed for insight meditation. Occasionally a meditator may experience disturbing mental images, in
                    which case it may help to open the eyes.</p>

                <p>Now you are ready to begin meditating. Choose one of the following exercises and practice it for at
                    least ten minutes. Remember that all physical movements, such as walking and moving the hands,
                    should be performed slowly, with continuous mindfulness. Shall we dive in?</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Resolution</a><br><span class="subtext">(Optional)</span></p>

                <p>You may wish to make a resolution before each practice-session. Doing so will help strengthen your
                    determination. You can use your own words, but the spirit of the aspiration should be something like
                    this: "By this practice of insight meditation may I reach the end of suffering. May others also
                    benefit from this wholesome action." Don't just repeat the words. Really concentrate on the resolve
                    for a moment or two.</p>

                </p>

                <p>We recommend this vipassana technique for everyone. Adopt one of the sitting postures. If you are
                    disabled or have a chronic illness you can do the exercise lying down.</p>

                <p>If you choose a sitting position, place your hands in your lap, palms facing upward, the right hand
                    on top of the left. If doing the exercise lying down, put your hands on the abdomen, one on top of
                    the other, or at your sides. Close your eyes.</p>

                <p>Next, direct your attention to the abdomen, an inch or two above the navel. Find the point that seems
                    clearest to you. Don't actually look at the spot. Just place your mind there. The point should lie
                    along the vertical midline of the body.</p>

                <p>As you breathe in, the abdomen expands; as you breathe out, it contracts. In meditation these
                    movements are called, respectively, "rising" and "falling." They never cease to alternate as long as
                    you live.</p>

                <p>As the abdomen rises, observe the motion from beginning to end with your mind. When the abdomen
                    falls, do the same. That's all there is to it. Just keep watching the rising and falling movements.
                    You don't have to do anything to them. Just know the movements without judging or describing
                    them.</p>

                <p>If it is difficult to perceive the rising and falling motions, put your hand on your stomach in order
                    to feel them clearly.</p>

                <p>Instead of making a continuous loop, the rising and falling motions are actually separate movements.
                    Imagine a rock thrown straight up in the air. When reaching the highest point the rock stops for a
                    fraction of a second before falling. Likewise, the abdomen stops rising for a moment before falling
                    back.</p>

                <p>As you do the exercise, restrict your attention to what is occurring in the <em>immediate present
                    moment</em>. Don't think about the past or future&mdash;don't think about anything at all. Let go of
                    worries, concerns, and memories. Empty your mind of everything except the abdominal movements
                    occurring right now. But don't <em>think</em> about them; just <em>know</em> them.</p>

                <p>It's important to understand that <em>knowing</em> bodily motion (or knowing anything) as it actually
                    is in the present moment is entirely different from thinking about it. In insight meditation the aim
                    is not to think, but only to know.</p>

                <p>To know an object during vipassana meditation means to experience it with bare, nonverbal awareness.
                    You merely register the sensation with impartial attention, without identifying, naming, judging or
                    describing it. You don't have to comment on the movements: "That falling motion lasted longer than
                    the previous one. That rising movement wasn't as clear as the others," and so on.</p>

                <p>As soon as there is bare awareness of the rising or falling movement, you are already knowing it. The
                    same is true of everything you might observe during meditation practice. <em>No matter what
                        appears</em>, just know it with bare attention for one moment and then let it go.</p>

                <p>Keeping your mind on the rising and falling movements may not be as easy as you'd think. Be patient
                    and don't judge yourself, even if the mind wanders out often. Remember that you're learning a new
                    skill. When learning to play the piano, for example, you wouldn't expect perfection right away.
                    Likewise, you shouldn't expect it in meditation. Don't get discouraged if your progress seems slow.
                    As long as you stick with the practice, results are sure to come.</p>

                <p>As a beginner, you should label the abdominal movements with a mental note. A mental note&mdash;also
                    called a "label"&mdash;is a word or short phrase said silently in the mind. The practice of mental
                    noting helps keep the mind on the meditation object and prevents you from getting distracted. But
                    this technique is only a temporary crutch. You should stop using the mental notes when mindfulness
                    is strong enough to observe objects without them. If you're not sure whether mindfulness is strong
                    enough, don't worry. In fact, the labels will fall away automatically when no longer useful, so you
                    don't have to make a deliberate decision to stop using them.</p>

                <p>Labeling an object with a mental note should not be confused with recognizing and inwardly saying the
                    ordinary name of the object, which is what we do in daily life as soon as we see or hear something.
                    Nor should we confuse mental noting with describing the object further. Mental notes support
                    mindfulness in the early stages by&nbsp;increasing momentary concentration. But even when using the
                    noting technique, we should focus on the actual experience of the object instead of on the label,
                    letting go of the conventional names, associations and meanings that in ordinary life are
                    automatically attached to sense-impressions.</p>

                <p>Here's how to use the mental noting technique with this exercise: As the abdomen expands, say the
                    word "rising" in your mind. When the abdomen contracts, say "falling." Continue to note <em>rising,
                        falling, rising, falling, rising, falling,</em> from one moment to the next.</p>

                <p>Only say the mental note one time per movement. For example, during one rising motion you would say
                    the word "rising" once, stretching the word out to last as long as the inhalation. When beginning to
                    exhale you would say "falling," stretching the word out to last as long as the exhalation. Again,
                    these words are said silently. And as we mentioned a moment ago, even when using the mental notes,
                    try to keep your attention on the actual movement instead of on the word. The aim is to know the
                    experience itself.</p>

                <p>The mental note should coincide with the motion, not be tagged on afterwards. Sometimes you might
                    catch yourself saying "falling" after the rising movement has begun, or vice-versa. In that case you
                    are no longer knowing the present moment. Just start over again from that point, noticing what is
                    actually happening <em>now</em>. Later we'll talk more about mental notes.</p>

                <p>During the rising-falling exercise don't focus on the breath or the physical components of the
                    abdomen. Keep your attention on the surface of the body and focus only on the <em>movement, </em>
                    which is perceived subjectively as a subtle sensation of tactile pressure, a sensation which keeps
                    changing from moment to moment.</p>

                <p>Imagine lying on your back, putting a coin or some other object on your stomach and, with your eyes
                    closed, mentally "watching" the coin move up and down as you breathe. Or think of a buoy on the
                    water, moving up and down with the waves. The coin and the buoy are like the spot on the abdomen,
                    and the meditator just follows the up and down movement.</p>

                <p>A couple of pointers: the abdomen should not be visualized. You only have to be aware of the
                    movements. And be sure to breathe naturally. Don't try to control your breath (but if you can't
                    perceive the abdominal motions you may take a few very deep breaths with your hand on your stomach
                    in order to help you sense the movements. Afterwards, let your breathing return to normal).</p>

                <p>If you can watch your abdomen rising and falling one time, you can practice insight meditation. Why
                    not try it right now before you continue reading? It will only take a few seconds.</p>

                <p>Close your eyes and inhale, observing one rising motion; then exhale, observing one falling motion.
                    Don't worry&mdash;this page will still be here waiting for you. It isn't going anywhere. You can
                    continue reading after trying the exercise. Let any resistance drop away. Go ahead and try it now,
                    on the count of three. One, two, three: Begin.</p>

                <p>Congratulations. You see? Insight meditation isn't difficult.</p>

                <p>Here is some additional information about observing the abdominal movements. A single rising movement
                    of the abdomen lasts about two or three seconds. It has a beginning, middle and end (and so does the
                    falling movement). Ideally your attention should be equally alert for the entire duration of the
                    movement. Notice the motion as the abdomen first begins to expand, keeping your attention continuous
                    throughout the development of the movement, until the abdomen reaches the highest point and stops
                    expanding. Don't just focus on the middle stage, which is the most obvious part. The beginning- and
                    end-points should be noticed, too. When the abdomen stops expanding, let go of the rising movement
                    and re-focus your attention on the beginning of the falling movement. Observe the falling movement
                    in the same way, from beginning to end.</p>

                <p>Please note, we're not saying you should mentally chop one abdominal movement into sections. One
                    rising or falling motion should be noticed smoothly, without breaks, until it is over, at which
                    point you would let it go. The same applies to the motion of the feet in walking meditation, the
                    movements of the hands in Exercise 3, and so on.</p>

                <p>The rising-falling exercise is not only for beginners. Most experienced meditators continue to use it
                    as their main practice. Even if you move on to the other exercises you should not forget about this
                    one, since the abdominal movements can be noted anywhere, any time.</p>

                <p>Motion belongs to the first foundation of mindfulness, the body. The rising-falling motions are
                    material form (in Pali, "rupa"). Regard them with a detached, scientific attitude. In the ultimate
                    sense, these movements do not belong to you. They are only impersonal phenomena, not your self. In
                    truth, they are not a part of you. They are not the mind, either. It is the mind (nama) that knows
                    them. Yet in ultimate terms the mind&mdash;what you call "your mind"&mdash;is not a self, but just
                    an impersonal faculty whose function is to be aware of something.</p>

                <p>Practice the rising-falling exercise anywhere from ten minutes to one hour. If you want to meditate
                    longer than an hour, it is best to alternate this exercise with walking meditation.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Observing Movement</a></p>

                <p>In many of the exercises presented here, the meditator watches bodily movement. When observing the
                    abdominal motions or any other form of bodily movement, the student should focus on the<em> movement
                        itself </em>instead of on the physical body part.</p>

                <p>The two ways of focusing might be compared to looking at a windmill in two different ways. We might
                    look at a windmill in order to discover the direction of the wind, or we might study the windmill's
                    structure because we're going to repair it. In the first case we only pay attention to the <em>motion </em>of
                    the windmill-blades&mdash;their speed and direction. We don't notice details about their shape,
                    structure and color. Who cares? The physical details of the blades tell us nothing whatsoever about
                    the wind, so there's no reason to focus on them. All we care about is the path they make through
                    space as they move.</p>

                <p>Likewise, although we are aware of the foot during walking meditation, we don’t care about its
                    corporeal mass, which only serves as a "marker" for the important part, the movement. Instead of
                    trying to feel each muscle or experience a deeper sensation within the foot, our focus is only on
                    the path it makes through space&mdash;the trajectory the foot describes in the air with each step.
                    All other bodily movements, including the abdominal motions and the movements of the hands in
                    Exercise 3, are observed in precisely the same way.</p>

                <p>Just watch the path of the movement, and do so <em>as it is happening.</em> Keep abreast of the
                    movement in the present moment so your awareness doesn't lag behind.</p>

                <div class="line">&nbsp;</div>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Limit Your Goal</a></p>

                <p>Sometimes you'll feel bored or uncomfortable during meditation. You might keep peeking at the clock,
                    wondering how much time has passed. Another twenty minutes to go! How will you get through it? Even
                    one more minute seems too much.</p>

                <p>When that happens, limit your goal. Just take it one breath at a time. Remind yourself, "I only have
                    to note one rising movement." Or, "I just have to note this single falling movement. Just this
                    much." To let go of your resistance, worry or aversion for one moment isn't hard (and even during
                    those times when it isn't easy, it's still <em>possible</em>). Then do it again for one more moment.
                    And again. In a few minutes the feeling of resistance may change by itself, because it's the nature
                    of the mind to change.</p>

                <p>So don't worry about the future during meditation practice. Let go. To think ahead, even if only to
                    the next breath, is to move away from the present moment. Then thoughts will get stirred up&mdash;distracting,
                    delusive thoughts about how difficult or boring meditation is. You'll think of many things you'd
                    rather be doing. Soon those thoughts will force you to stand up and walk away from the cushion
                    without having finished your meditation session. It's important not to follow those thoughts,
                    because they are nothing but the mind's attempt to trick you into giving up. Instead of allowing
                    such thoughts to control you, just stay in the now. Take it one moment at a time.</p>

                <p>If meditation seems very difficult or you lack self-discipline, try this strategy: decide you will
                    meditate just one minute per day. Anyone can do that, right? You will find, however, that once you
                    get "over the hump" of your initial resistance and actually sit down to do it, you might sometimes
                    want to meditate longer. It's that initial hurdle that's the most difficult. But even if you don't
                    end up meditating longer, keep practicing one minute every day, <em>without exception</em>, and your
                    attitude will gradually change.</p>

                <p>While observing the abdominal movements, other phenomena will sometimes intrude&mdash;thoughts,
                    sensations of itching, pain, numbness, emotions, sounds, and so forth. In the following sections
                    we'll discuss how to deal with some of these objects.</p>

                <div class="line">&nbsp;</div>

                <a name="h"></a>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Primary and Secondary Objects</a></p>

                <p>Every meditation technique uses a meditation object: something to focus your mind on. In Exercise 1,
                    the rising and falling abdominal motions are the primary or main object. Although you should try to
                    keep your attention on the primary object, other phenomena may be noticed at times. (We'll talk
                    about when to notice them in a moment.) These other things are called "secondary objects."</p>

                <p>Here we should explain that the word "object" has a special meaning in vipassana practice. It does
                    not refer to a three-dimensional Thing like a desk or a bicycle. An object means something that is
                    <em>known by</em> the mind (something you're aware of) in the present moment, as opposed to the
                    subject that is knowing it. The subject is the mind or "knower." (Yet, in the ultimate sense, the
                    subject is not a self but the mere faculty of knowing).</p>

                <p>In vipassana, an object of awareness can be either material or mental. Practically speaking, a
                    "material object" refers to a sense-impression: color, sound, odor, tactile sensation (including
                    bodily movement), and flavor. A mental object refers to such things as pleasant or unpleasant
                    feeling, desire, anxiety, peacefulness, anger, thought, and so on.</p>

                <p>As we said, while you're observing the rising-falling movements other phenomena will be appearing and
                    disappearing. You might be aware of sounds. Sometimes you'll experience emotions and thoughts. You
                    might feel itches, numbness or discomfort in the body, or you might feel very peaceful. All of these
                    are secondary objects. In short, a secondary object is anything you're aware of that is not the
                    primary meditation object.</p>

                <p>When should you deliberately focus on a secondary object? If a secondary object makes only a faint
                    impression on the periphery of your awareness and does not strongly hook your attention, ignore it
                    and continue observing the primary meditation object. In that case, of course, you don't need to
                    label the secondary object with a mental note.</p>

                <p>But if a secondary object hooks your attention and pulls it away, or if it causes desire or aversion
                    to appear, you should focus on the secondary object for a moment or two, labeling it with a mental
                    note. After that, drop it and resume watching the primary meditation object. Only observe one thing
                    at a time.</p>

                <div class="line">&nbsp;</div>

                <a name="i"></a>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Mental Noting</a></p>

                <p>A mental note identifies an object in general but not in detail. When you're aware of a sound, for
                    example, label it "hearing" instead of "motorcycle," "voices" or "barking dog." If an unpleasant
                    sensation arises, note "pain" or "feeling" instead of "knee pain" or "my back pain." Then return
                    your attention to the primary meditation object. When aware of a fragrance, say the mental note
                    "smelling" for a moment or two. You don't have to identify the scent.</p>

                <p>Your eyes will usually be closed during the rising-falling exercise, so you won't have much occasion
                    to see. But sometimes you might want to open your eyes, such as when changing posture. When you are
                    aware of color, note the bare sensation of seeing for a moment or two, labeling it "seeing." Don't
                    pay attention to what the sight is an image <em>of</em>, or whether it's attractive or unattractive.
                    Then go back to observing the primary meditation object.</p>

                <p>Using mental notes helps prevent clinging and aversion from arising. But as soon as an object is
                    noted it should be let go of. Even the sensation or thought you noted one moment before should not
                    be kept in the mind. In meditation practice every phenomenon should be dropped as soon as it is
                    noticed.</p>

                <p>A mental note should usually be limited to one or two words. If it's too long another object will
                    have arisen before you finish saying the note. A mental note should also be a word easily recalled
                    so you don't have to search your mind for it. Don't waste time looking for the right mental note.
                    That will take you out of the present moment. If you don't know what to call something use the
                    general label "knowing."</p>

                <p>If an object has already disappeared before you were able to label it, don't go back and tag on the
                    label. Let go of all the previous objects and start over again from this moment, by noting whatever
                    is being experienced <em>now</em>. But if most of the objects that arise seem "faster" than the
                    mental notes, you don't need to use the notes any more.</p>

                <p>However, although the labeling technique is mainly for beginners, even advanced meditators benefit
                    from using it when mindfulness and concentration are weak. Don't be afraid to compare both
                    procedures. Use the mental notes, and then drop them for awhile. What is the difference? Are you
                    able to focus on the present-moment object equally well in both cases? Eventually you'll know
                    instinctively when the labels are useful and when they merely get in the way.</p>

                <p>Remember: the mental notes are said silently at the exact moment of perceiving the object, not added
                    later.</p>

                <p>The instructions for noting secondary objects apply to all the meditation exercises in this
                    article.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Wandering Mind</a></p>

                <p>In the beginning your mind will often wander during meditation, spinning out thoughts about the past
                    and future. Be assured this is normal; but what should you do when it happens? The strategy is
                    simple: When you catch yourself thinking, silently say the mental note "thinking" for a moment or
                    two, and then gently return your attention to the rising-falling movements (or whatever primary
                    meditation object you were observing).</p>

                <p>But after gaining some experience in vipassana practice you may notice thoughts that are very faint
                    or in the "background" of awareness and don't hook your attention. Before you can label them with a
                    mental note, they're already gone. In that case there's no need to label the thoughts. Just keep
                    observing the primary meditation object and ignore the thoughts, which will fall away on their
                    own.</p>

                <p>The latter approach is mainly for intermediate and advanced meditators. Since it is more difficult
                    for beginners to notice when they are thinking, there's a greater chance the mind will be hooked by
                    a thought and get carried away on a long tangent before you realize it. Immediately labeling
                    thinking with a mental note helps prevent this.</p>

                <p>Don't get upset or judge yourself when the mind wanders away. Keep gently bringing it back to the
                    main meditation object. Be patient with yourself and understand that it's the nature of the mind to
                    think, so training it to stay in the present moment and <em>just know</em> takes time.</p>

                <p>Actually, if you are aware the mind has wandered it means you are being mindful. If you didn't have
                    mindfulness, you wouldn't <em>know </em>the mind had drifted away. In daily life we're unaware how
                    distracted and agitated our minds truly are. Only when making an effort to meditate can we see the
                    full extent of the mind's restlessness as it jumps from one thought to the next. The suttas compare
                    it to a monkey in a tree jumping from branch to branch.</p>

                <p>When you catch the mind wandering you might be tempted to wonder, "How long have I been thinking?
                    When did I lose track of the rising-falling motions?" But those are more thoughts, and even as
                    you're thinking them more rising-falling movements are passing by unnoticed. Don't go back to find
                    the spot where you lost mindfulness or try to reconstruct the links in the cognitive chain. You
                    can't bring those past moments back in order to acknowledge them. Let them go and start over again
                    from <em>this </em>moment.</p>

                <p>One reason the mind easily wanders off on tangents is that we tend to believe wholeheartedly in the
                    content of our thoughts, and so whenever a thought arises we get mesmerized by its "story." We may
                    not think of ourselves as people who are easily fooled, but this is one area in which most of us are
                    completely gullible, especially when the thought carries an emotional charge. When pleasant thoughts
                    appear we get caught up in the fantasies, fueled by desire. When unpleasant memories arise we focus
                    on how we were wronged, getting more and more upset. Whether the content of the thought is pleasant
                    or unpleasant, we tend to assume it has substance instead of recognizing that it's just an empty
                    vibration arising and passing away.</p>

                <p>During vipassana practice meditators should try to ignore the content of their thoughts completely.
                    It doesn't matter whether a thought is good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant; the conventional meaning
                    is irrelevant in meditation. The attitude is to look upon all thoughts as general instances of
                    "thinking," without paying attention to the details that differentiate one thought from another. All
                    thoughts (indeed, all objects) have equal value in vipassana practice.</p>

                <p>We don't have to feel guilty about having unwholesome thoughts. The key is to be aware of them as
                    soon as they arise. If we're aware of them in the present moment, mindfulness is already there.
                    Everyone has bad thoughts at times. In reality most thoughts arise spontaneously due to causes we
                    cannot directly control. Instead of trying to suppress them during meditation, the right approach is
                    to "know and let go."</p>

                <p>Imagine two meditators: the first has many angry thoughts but doesn't get involved in them (or act on
                    them, of course). He notes and lets go of them right away. The second meditator clings to beautiful
                    thoughts about the Buddhist teachings. Which student is practicing vipassana correctly? The
                    first.</p>

                <p>When a meditator is aware of a thought early enough, he realizes, "The thought was not in existence
                    before; it appeared just now and disappeared at once. I had previously imagined thought to be
                    permanent because I had not carefully observed it. Now that I have watched it, and seen it
                    disappearing, I know it truly as it is, impermanent" (Mahasi Sayadaw,<em> The Great Discourse on
                        Not-Self</em>, pp. 115&mdash;6).</p>

                <p>It is important to understand how to observe thinking correctly because, as Mahasi Sayadaw explains,
                    thoughts and tactile sensations&mdash;especially sensations of bodily movement&mdash;are the most
                    frequent objects of contemplation. Even exalted thoughts about the Buddhist teachings should be let
                    go of, as should painful thoughts.</p>

                <p>When no thoughts or other secondary objects distract you, your attention should stay with the primary
                    meditation object.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">One Object at a Time</a></p>

                <p>The vipassana technique involves focusing on one thing at a time. That doesn't mean you have to
                    observe one object exclusively for the entire meditation period. It means focusing on<em> one thing
                        per moment</em>. Observing two objects or sense-impressions in the same moment "confuses"
                    mindfulness. Therefore, when observing a rising or a falling motion, ignore other objects. Don't pay
                    attention to sounds, thoughts, feelings or smells.</p>

                <p>But it should be understood that in any two consecutive moments the meditation object may be
                    different. In vipassana your attention may jump from one meditation object to another. You might
                    observe a falling movement of the abdomen, and then in the next moment observe a sound. So even if
                    you sit down to practice the rising-falling exercise for thirty minutes, it doesn't mean you will
                    observe the abdominal movements during every single moment of that half-hour period. Secondary
                    objects will sometimes hook you, and whenever you deliberately note a secondary object you should
                    switch all of your attention to it (even if just for that one moment). Whatever object you're
                    observing at any given moment should be the <em>only</em> thing you focus on in that moment.</p>

                <p>For instance, if a sound pulls your attention away from the abdominal movements, switch your
                    attention to the sound and note "hearing" for a moment or two. For those few seconds ignore
                    everything else, including the rising-falling motions. (While doing this you might still be aware of
                    other phenomena in the background or on the periphery of consciousness. That's all right. The point
                    is you are not <em>intentionally</em> focusing on them). After one or two moments of noting
                    "hearing," return your attention to the primary meditation object and forget about the sound. The
                    same procedure applies to anything else you might observe&mdash;thoughts, emotions, itches, smells,
                    feelings, and so on.</p>

                <p>By focusing on one object at a time, a meditator is able to perceive the three phases of each moment&mdash;arising,
                    persisting, and vanishing&mdash;more and more clearly. On the other hand, if a beginner tries to be
                    aware in a general way of whatever comes up, noticing is vague. Because his attention is scattered
                    across several objects at once, none is particularly clear. Since he is trying to observe the whole
                    stream of experience simultaneously, he may not know which object he’s noticing at any given moment,
                    and it is difficult to gain insight.</p>

                <p>When two or more objects&mdash;such as a movement and a sound&mdash;occur simultaneously, the general
                    rule is to observe the one that makes the strongest impact on the mind, or the one that triggers
                    more desire or aversion.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Know and Let Go</a></p>

                <p>As we explain throughout this article, the vipassana motto is: know and let go. Or we can say, "Focus
                    and forget it." They mean the same thing. All insight meditators should memorize one of these
                    phrases.</p>

                <p>The letting go or "forgetting" is just as important as the knowing or focusing. During meditation
                    practice a student focuses on one thing at a time and then lets it go. He keeps "knowing and letting
                    go" repeatedly, from one moment to the next. In Exercise 1, for example, we focus on the rising
                    movement of the abdomen, and then drop it. In the next moment we observe the falling movement, and
                    then let <em>it </em> go. The moment after that we're aware of the rising movement again; as soon as
                    it ends we forget it. And so on.</p>

                <p>That's how to describe the procedure in words. But in practice, as we explain elsewhere, "letting go"
                    is not a separate action. Letting go of the previous meditation object happens automatically every
                    time we focus in the present again.</p>

                <p>Let's take another look at Exercise 1. We observe one rising movement of the abdomen until it ends.
                    Immediately after that, in the next moment, we bring our attention to observe the falling movement.
                    But in the act of bringing our attention into the present again to see the falling movement, the
                    rising motion is simultaneously forgotten. In truth, consciousness can only be aware of one thing at
                    a time. It has to let go of the previous object in order to know something else.</p>

                <p>That's why we don't have to let go <em>as a separate step.</em> Letting go and re-establishing our
                    attention in the present moment are the same. Letting go of the past happens by itself whenever we
                    truly bring the mind back to the here and now. But re-establishing our attention in the present is
                    something we have to <em>keep </em>doing, gently, with every single moment. The present is not
                    static. There is always a new "present moment."</p>

                <p>Therefore, what we are actually doing during vipassana practice is: <em>knowing, knowing,
                    knowing,</em> in a chain of moments. Or we could describe it like this: <em>knowing-the-present,
                    knowing-the-present, knowing-the-present.</em> In an article for tricycle.com, Joseph Goldstein
                    describes how to do this with the abdominal movements: "Train your awareness to connect clearly with
                    the first moment of the beginning in-breath. Then sustain the attention for the duration of just
                    that one in-coming breath. Connect again at the beginning of the outbreath and sustain your
                    attention till the end." (http://www.tricycle.com/brief-teachings/meditation-instructions). As
                    meditators, our only job is keep bringing the mind back to knowing what is happening right here in
                    <em>this </em>present moment. And now <em>this </em>one. And <em>this </em>one.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Itching</a></p>

                <p>During vipassana practice you might feel an itch somewhere on the body. In daily life sensations of
                    itchiness arise frequently, but since the normal response is to scratch the itch unconsciously,
                    without clear mindfulness, people don't realize it happens hundreds of times per day. As a result of
                    meditating, you begin to see that uncomfortable bodily sensations arise much more often than you had
                    thought.</p>

                <p>If you can keep your attention on the principal object and let the itch stay in the "background," it
                    will often disappear by itself. If it doesn't disappear but becomes more uncomfortable, just watch
                    the sensation for a few moments, saying the mental note "feeling" or "itching." Desire might arise&mdash;desire
                    to be rid of the feeling. Label it "wanting" or "desire." (Here you don't observe the sensation of
                    itchiness per se, but the wanting itself, which is a different object).</p>

                <p>If the itch persists and you have to scratch it, use the following step-by-step technique:</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Observe the desire to be rid of the feeling, saying the mental note "desire."</li>

                    <li>Before moving your hand, note "intending to move."</li>

                    <li>Mindfully move your hand to the itchy spot, noting "moving."</li>

                    <li>When you reach the spot, stop moving your hand for a moment and note, "intending to scratch."
                    </li>

                    <li>Scratch the itch, noting "moving" or "scratching." Stop.</li>

                    <li>Move your hand back, saying the mental note "moving." Stop.</li>

                    <li>Put your hand in your lap, noting "placing." Now you are back in the original meditation
                        posture.
                    </li>

                    <li>Note the pleasant feeling that has replaced the unpleasant one, labeling it "feeling" for one or
                        two moments. Notice if liking arises for the good sensation. If it does, label it "liking" or
                        "desire."
                    </li>

                    <li>Resume watching the primary meditation object.</li>

                </ol>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Pain</a></p>

                <p>Whenever you keep the body in the same position without moving it, sooner or later pain will arise.
                    How should you deal with pain during meditation practice?</p>

                <p>Instead of automatically shifting the body when you feel discomfort, try to observe the sensation
                    itself, labeling it with the mental note "pain" or "feeling." Sometimes the pain will disappear on
                    its own. Sometimes it will grow stronger first, and then diminish or disappear. In any case, by
                    observing unpleasant feeling you will notice that it does not stay the same. It changes from moment
                    to moment. Like everything else, pain is impermanent.</p>

                <p>But if the pain becomes too severe you should change position. Beginners shouldn't try to grit their
                    teeth and tough it out. Only advanced meditators can observe severe pain effectively. The object is
                    too heavy for a beginner's mindfulness to "lift."</p>

                <p>On the other hand, you don't want to change position at every little twitch or tingle. Don't give in
                    to desire easily. Meditators won't make progress without the patience to bear many unpleasant
                    feelings. Only change position if you cannot tolerate the discomfort and it is interfering with your
                    mindfulness.</p>

                <p>If you decide to change position, follow this step-by-step technique:</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Observe the sensation of pain for a few moments, labeling it "pain" or "feeling".</li>

                    <li>Note the desire to be rid of the pain. If possible, wait until your mind is no longer struggling
                        against the painful feeling before going to the next step.
                    </li>

                    <li>Say the mental note "intending to move."</li>

                    <li>Slowly move the body into the new posture, noting "moving." Break the entire action into several
                        smaller movements, stopping fully after each one. This creates clear objects for mindfulness.
                    </li>

                    <li>Note the pleasant feeling that has replaced the pain, labeling it "pleasure" or "feeling" for a
                        moment or two. If you like the feeling, label it "liking," or "desire."
                    </li>

                    <li>Resume watching the primary meditation object.</li>

                </ol>

                <p>By practicing insight meditation we gradually realize there is no bodily position comfortable enough
                    that we can always maintain it. Pain inevitably appears, even when lying down (if you doubt this,
                    ask anyone who is bedridden in the hospital). No matter how comfortable the position is initially,
                    we are always forced to move because of the changing nature of the physical elements. That is one
                    way in which the body is unsatisfactory, or a cause of suffering.</p>

                <p>For more advanced meditators there is an additional method for dealing with physical pain, which is
                    to disengage your attention from it and observe the mind itself.</p>

                <p>Sometimes when you have bodily pain, even in daily life, the mind is momentarily distracted from it.
                    When you're aware of the pain again you realize that for those few moments of thinking about your
                    finances, or an argument you had with a loved one, or the things you need to buy at the store, you
                    didn't actually feel the discomfort anymore. Why? Because the mind was occupied with something else.
                    It is a fact that consciousness can only know one thing at a time. When you are thinking about
                    something else you cannot be aware of pain at the same time.</p>

                <p>From this experience you realize that when the mind lets go of pain and focuses on a different
                    object, the pain effectively disappears. But that's not to say you should think and fantasize during
                    meditation practice. You should stay in the present moment, but separate or disengage your mind from
                    the feeling and put your attention on the mind itself&mdash;the knower or the one knowing the
                    experience. You may then see that the mind or knower arises and passes away from moment to
                    moment.</p>

                <p>With this method you let the pain be there in the background if it's going to, but you don't pay
                    attention to it. The attitude is that you don't have to get involved with the pain or worry about
                    it. The unpleasant feeling is solely the business of the body. If you can separate your mind from
                    the pain and let go of it, you won't experience the suffering in the same way as before. Then, even
                    though the physical sensation may still be there, it won't be experienced as "hurt", and it won't
                    make the mind suffer. But this is an advanced technique which is not recommended for beginners.</p>

                <p>Generally speaking, when feelings arise during meditation they should be observed and labeled with a
                    mental note. That is not only true of unpleasant feelings such as pain. If you fail to observe a
                    pleasant feeling when it arises, attachment can develop. Before you're even aware of it, you will
                    cling to the feeling. It is easy to get caught up in pleasure and forget about staying in the
                    present moment. Whether a feeling is painful or pleasant, after noting it for a moment or two, let
                    it go.</p>

                <p>You should also be aware of any desire that arises in connection with feeling&mdash;whether the
                    desire to get rid of a painful sensation or to prolong a pleasant one. When desire arises, label it
                    with a mental note.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Mental Images</a></p>

                <p>Some meditators see vivid mental images when reaching a certain stage of insight. Others never see
                    such visions. Whether or not they appear depends in part on the student's temperament. The images
                    might be of anything at all: people, animals, gardens, colors, decaying bodies, abstract shapes, or
                    even the Buddha.</p>

                <p>These visions can range from exquisitely beautiful to very frightening. But no matter how vivid they
                    seem, these images are not real. They are mental formations that arise from imagination (coupled
                    with concentration) and have no significance. They are neither good nor bad. The meditator should
                    neither desire nor fear them.</p>

                <p>If an image occurs, try to focus on the primary meditation object again (such as the rising-falling
                    motions), ignoring the image. Let the image remain in the "background," but don't pay attention to
                    it. Eventually the image will fade away.</p>

                <p>If the image persists and interferes with your practice, there are several things you can do:</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Practice with your eyes open.</li>

                    <li>Label the image with a mental note. (You can use the word "image" or "seeing," although it
                        should be understood that knowing a mental image is not the same as genuine seeing.) Continue to
                        note the image from moment-to-moment until it disappears. The image will often disappear after
                        several notings.
                    </li>

                    <li>Switch to a different meditation exercise. If you are sitting, get up and practice walking
                        meditation or do the hand motions exercise.
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <p>If you note the image with the aim of getting rid of it due to aversion or fear, it will last longer.
                    Enjoying the vision will also make it persist. Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, try to note the
                    image impartially, just as you would any other object, without liking or disliking it.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Mindfulness When Changing Posture</a></p>

                <p>Insight meditators usually alternate a period of sitting with an equal period of walking meditation,
                    especially during an intensive retreat in which vipassana is practiced many hours per day.</p>

                <p>During the transition between postures it is crucial to maintain step-by-step mindfulness. When the
                    sitting time is over, resist the temptation to jump up suddenly or automatically stretch your back
                    or legs without being mindful of your movements. In the long run, even a few moments of speeding up
                    will slow you down. Careless movements cause a break in continuity that scatters mindfulness.</p>

                <p>In the old days before lighters and matches, fire could only be produced by rubbing two sticks
                    together until the friction created a spark. Continuity of effort was essential in getting a flame.
                    If you stopped to rest, the sticks would go cold and you'd have to start over. Continuity is just as
                    important in vipassana practice.</p>

                <p>Here we'll describe how to change from sitting to standing in a step-by-step manner, enabling you to
                    maintain mindfulness. The same principles apply to all the other postures.</p>

                <p>First, note your intention as "intending to move." Next, start moving the body slowly, breaking the
                    motion down into a series of separate actions. Stop completely after each movement. Bring each hand
                    to your stomach one at a time. Tilt your torso forward as you prepare to stand. Uncross your legs.
                    Lift one leg and then the other. Note the feeling of pressure against each foot as you place it on
                    the floor, and then slowly stand up.</p>

                <p>Each of these actions should be performed slowly, methodically, and observed from beginning to end.
                    Whenever possible, move only one body part at a time. It's very important to stop fully at the end
                    of each movement. Label each action with an appropriate mental note or simply note "moving."</p>

                <p>Once the body is upright you should observe the standing posture for a few moments, noting
                    "standing." This means to focus awareness on the position or shape of the body, being aware of how
                    it feels. If this is difficult you can focus on one point, such as the spot where the soles of your
                    feet touch the floor. (For a more detailed description of how to observe bodily posture, please see
                    Exercise 4).</p>

                <p>Whether you are standing, sitting, or lying down, apply this step-by-step technique whenever you
                    change posture during vipassana practice.</p>

                <p>Below are a series of drawings that illustrate the reverse process, changing from standing to
                    sitting, in even more detail. Here the process has been broken down into sixteen steps (this
                    information has been adapted from Helen Jandamit's book, <em>The Way to Vipassana</em>, Bangkok,
                    V.H. Publications, 1990).</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Begin by standing with your feet together, arms at your sides (alternatively, you may hold your
                        arms in front of the body, one hand clasping the wrist of the other). Move your left foot
                        backwards, noting "moving."
                    </li>

                    <li>Slowly bend your knees, noting "moving" or "down".<br>

                        <img class="posture" src="figure01a.jpg" alt=""></li>

                    <li>As your left knee touches the ground, note "touching".<br>

                        <img class="posture" src="figure02a.jpg" alt=""></li>

                    <li>Move your left hand toward the floor, noting "moving."</li>

                    <li>Place your left hand on the floor, noting "touching" (your hand needs to be in this position to
                        support the body prior to moving the right leg).<br>

                        <img class="posture" src="figure03a.jpg" alt=""></li>

                    <li>Move the right leg back until it is parallel with the left leg, noting "moving."</li>

                    <li>When the right leg touches the floor, note "touching".<br>

                        <img class="posture" src="figure04a.jpg" alt=""></li>

                    <li>Move your left hand backwards, noting "moving."</li>

                    <li>As your left hand touches the floor, note "touching".<br>

                        <img class="posture" src="figure05a.jpg" alt=""></li>

                    <li>Lower your body until you are sitting, noting "lowering".<br>

                        <img class="posture" src="figure06a.jpg" alt=""></li>

                    <li>Move the left foot backwards so that it is further under your body (it should be in the correct
                        position to sit cross-legged), noting "moving."
                    </li>

                    <li>Lifting the right knee, move the right foot forwards, noting "moving".<br>

                        <img class="posture" src="figure07a.jpg" alt=""></li>

                    <li>Reach your right arm forward and take hold of your right ankle, noting "grasping".<br>

                        <img class="posture" src="figure08a.jpg" alt=""></li>

                    <li>Lift the right foot, noting "lifting."</li>

                    <li>Move the foot towards the body, noting, "moving".<br>

                        <img class="posture" src="figure09a.jpg" alt=""></li>

                    <li>Set your foot on the floor, noting "placing".<br>

                        <img class="posture" src="figure10a.jpg" alt=""></li>

                    <li>Put your hands in your lap one by one, noting "moving."</li>

                </ol>

                <p>This series of movements is only one of many possibilities, and does not have to be followed
                    precisely. If you have a disability or other chronic physical problem you may need to alter the
                    steps. Adjustments will also have to be made if you meditate in a chair. The important thing is to
                    follow the principle of breaking down larger movements into separate, smaller actions that can be
                    noted one at a time, and to stop completely at the end of each action before beginning the next.
                    Also, be sure to acknowledge each movement with a mental note, especially if you're a beginner. You
                    may devise your own notes; the ones given here are only suggestions.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Exercise 2: Walking Meditation</a></p>

                <p>Walking meditation is an important vipassana technique. The basic walking meditation exercise is
                    similar to normal walking, only slower and more deliberate. Your attention should be minutely
                    focused on each action.</p>

                <p>The primary object during walking meditation is the motion of the feet. Observing the movement of the
                    feet is essentially no different from watching the abdominal movements or the motions of the hand in
                    Exercise 3. Don't try to feel the muscles in the foot, or a sensation in the foot. Instead, observe
                    the <em>movement itself</em>. In other words, with each step observe the path the foot makes as it
                    moves through space.</p>

                <p>Pay no attention to the abdominal movements during this exercise. As we said before, only observe one
                    object per moment.</p>

                <p>One final note: don't look at your feet. Just be aware of the movements with your mind.</p>

                <p>The best environment is one with few visual distractions. Remove your shoes, if possible. You should
                    have enough space to walk at least seven paces in a straight line.</p>

                <p>Follow the instructions on changing from sitting to standing.</p>

                <p>Once you are standing, hold your hands in front of your body, one hand gently clasping the wrist of
                    the other. Instead of looking around the room, keep your eyes directed straight ahead or slightly
                    downcast toward the floor (but don't bend your neck too far forward, which may cause discomfort).
                    Try not to turn your head independently. Even when you turn around at the end of the walking path,
                    keep your head in a straight line with your spine, as if you were wearing a neck brace. Move your
                    whole body as one unit on the turn. Relax your shoulders.</p>

                    <br><span class="subtext">(Suitable for beginners)</span></p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Observe the standing posture, noting "standing" for a few moments. This means to focus awareness
                        on the posture of the body as you stand (for a more detailed description of how to observe
                        posture, see Exercise 4). If this is difficult you can choose one point to focus on, such as the
                        soles of your feet, being aware of the feeling of pressure from touching the floor.
                    </li>

                    <li>Before moving, note "intending to walk." (Don't skip this step).</li>

                    <li>Slowly lift the right foot and place it down, taking one step. This should be a single fluid
                        motion without breaks. Be aware of the entire arc of movement from beginning to end. As you do
                        so, label the step "placing" (remember to label while the motion is happening, not afterwards).
                        The left foot should not have moved and the left heel should still be on the ground. After
                        placing the right foot down, stop completely for a moment.
                    </li>

                    <li>Slowly take a step with the left foot, noting "placing." Stop.</li>

                    <li>Continue walking, making sure to stop completely after each step. Only move one foot at a
                        time.
                    </li>

                    <li>When you reach the end of the walking path, place your feet together on the last step, noting
                        "stopping."
                    </li>

                    <li>Note "standing" for two or three moments.</li>

                    <li>Now you will begin to turn, in four steps. Note "intending to turn."</li>

                    <li>Lift the toes of your right foot and pivot on the heel, turning to your right. At the same time,
                        say the mental note "turning." The right heel should stay on the ground. Be sure to keep your
                        head in line with your torso. The left foot should not move. Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Lift the left foot and place it down next to the right, while noting "turning". (The left foot
                        doesn't pivot, but steps.) You should have moved about ninety degrees. Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Pivot on the right heel again, noting "turning." Stop.</li>

                    <li>Lift the left foot and place it down next to the right, noting "turning." By now you should be
                        facing in the opposite direction, having turned one-hundred-and-eighty degrees.
                    </li>

                    <li>Repeat steps 1-12 as many times as you wish.</li>

                </ol>

                <p>That is the basic exercise. Next we'll give five variations in which each step is broken down into a
                    series of smaller movements. Substitute any variation for instructions number 3 and 4 above. The
                    rest of the exercise is the same.</p>

                <p>A word of advice: don't try the variations until you are adept at the basic exercise. And don't
                    proceed to the next variation until you've mastered the previous one, even if that takes a month, a
                    year, or longer. (During an intensive meditation retreat, however, you might spend only one day on
                    each variation.)</p>

                <p>Remember that the "resting" foot should not come off the floor until the active foot has finished
                    moving. Don't forget to stop completely after each segment of a step.</p>

                </p>

                <p>This exercise is similar to walking (and rising-falling) in that you watch the body's physical
                    movement. By focusing on a different part of the body, however, you give mindfulness a larger
                    repertoire of objects, just as a weightlifter trains different muscles in rotation.</p>

                <p>Since mindfulness sometimes gets "bored" or slows down when observing the same object for a long time
                    (especially during a meditation retreat), changing to another primary meditation object can help
                    mindfulness maintain strength and continuity. And because some of the movements here are shorter
                    than in the other exercises, mindfulness is able to observe more "moments" in the same amount of
                    practice time.</p>

                <p>The hand motions exercise, performed while sitting or lying down, is especially useful for those who
                    can't do the walking practice due to illness or disability. Note: you don't have to look at your
                    hand. Just watch the movement with your mind.</p>

                <p class="subhd">Exercise A</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Adopt one of the sitting postures, or lie down. Place your hands on your knees, palms facing
                        downward. (If lying down, place your hands at your sides, palms touching the floor).
                    </li>

                    <li>Slowly rotate your right hand laterally (to your right) until it is resting on edge,
                        perpendicular to the knee. There should be no space between the fingers. Stop completely for a
                        moment.
                    </li>

                    <li>Raise your hand straight up about eight inches. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Lower the hand back down, stopping when it's an inch or two from the knee.</li>

                    <li>Continue moving your hand down until the lateral side of the little finger touches the knee.
                        Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Rotate the hand medially until the palm is resting on the knee. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Repeat steps 2-6. Beginners should label the actions with the following mental notes: "turning,"
                        "raising," "lowering," "touching," "turning." Practice with one hand alone, anywhere from five
                        to thirty minutes. Then change to the other hand, giving it equal time.
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <p class="subhd">Exercise B</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Adopt one of the sitting postures or lie down. Place your hands on your knees, palms facing
                        downward. (If lying down, place your hands at your sides, palms touching the floor).
                    </li>

                    <li>Slowly rotate your right hand laterally (to your right) until it is resting on edge,
                        perpendicular to the knee. There should not be any space between the fingers. Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Raise your hand straight up about six inches. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Pivoting from the elbow, slowly swing the hand and forearm inward toward the center of the body,
                        stopping a couple of inches before touching the abdomen. The hand and wrist should remain in a
                        straight line with the arm. The fingertips will now be pointing to the left and the palm will be
                        facing the abdomen. Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Place the right hand against the abdomen. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Rotate the left hand laterally (to your left) until it is resting on edge, perpendicular to the
                        knee. Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Raise the left hand straight up about six inches. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Pivoting from the elbow, swing the left hand and forearm inward toward the center of the body,
                        stopping when a couple of inches from the abdomen.
                    </li>

                    <li>Place the left hand against the right. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Now you will repeat the motions in reverse order. Swing the left forearm out until the hand is
                        again above the knee. The hand and wrist should stay in a straight line with the arm. Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Lower the hand straight down, stopping an inch or two above the knee. The hand is still
                        perpendicular to the knee.
                    </li>

                    <li>Continue moving the left hand down until the lateral side of the little finger touches the knee.
                        Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Rotate the hand medially until the palm is resting on the knee. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Repeat steps 10-13 with the right hand. You may label the movements with the following mental
                        notes: for steps 2-5 and 6-9: turning, raising, moving, touching. For steps 10-13: moving,
                        lowering, touching, turning. Practice this exercise anywhere from five minutes to one hour.
                    </li>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Exercise 4: Sitting</a></p>

                <p>(Beginners can practice this for a few minutes before doing the rising-falling exercise. Intermediate
                    or advanced students can practice it longer. We don't recommend beginners practice it for the entire
                    meditation period, because posture is a more difficult object to observe than physical
                    movement.)</p>

                <p>In the previous exercises you had a moving object. Here you will observe a stationary object&mdash;the
                    sitting posture itself (strictly speaking, however, movement is still present, because the mind
                    moves). With your mind you are going to look repeatedly at the body's posture, as it appears in the
                    present moment.</p>

                <p>Adopt a comfortable sitting position. Now, focus your awareness on the&nbsp;posture of the body as it
                    sits. (Pay no attention to the rising-falling motions.) The body is adopting a shape that differs
                    from standing or lying down. This may seem obvious, but there is a difference between the vague,
                    intermittent awareness of posture we have in daily life, an awareness interrupted by talking or
                    thinking of a thousand things, and an attention that is wholly focused on that pose.</p>

                <p>Just "look" with your mind's eye to know what the sitting posture is like&mdash;how it feels&mdash;in
                    this very moment. If it's difficult to be aware of the whole posture at once, place your attention
                    on one area, such as your hands in your lap. As you focus on the posture, label it with the mental
                    note "sitting."</p>

                <p>After focusing one time, do it again. The method is simply to observe the posture for one moment, let
                    it go, and then immediately bring the mind back to the sitting posture again. This is done gently,
                    with a light touch. Watch this action again and again&mdash;i.e., the action of bringing the mind to
                    look at the sitting posture. Simply be aware of <em>knowing sitting</em>.</p>

                <p>Each act or instance of focusing should be fairly quick, lasting about one-and-a-half to three
                    seconds (but you don't need to time it, of course). Another way to think of it is that you focus for
                    as long as it takes to say the word "sitting," or roughly as long as one inhalation. Then let go,
                    and focus on sitting again.</p>

                <p>What you should be aware of is not a visual image of the posture, but the kinesthetic experience or
                    "feel" of it. There is a tactile feeling when you hold the back upright as you sit. You will also
                    experience sensations of pressure at various points where your body contacts the floor or one leg
                    presses against another. There will also be a feeling of contact where the hands touch each
                    other.</p>

                <p>Please don't misunderstand: you <em>don't </em>need to observe these various sensations individually,
                    in detail. When practicing the exercise, don't try to examine them one by one. Look at the whole
                    thing at once, in one fell swoop. Notice the feel of the entire sitting posture in the present
                    moment. Then do it again in the next present moment. The meditator is aware of the whole posture
                    each time with the aim of understanding that this is all there is to "sitting"&mdash;only a
                    momentary group of sensations, nothing more. It is not stable. It is constantly changing. (Again,
                    however, if it is difficult to be aware of the entire posture at once you may focus on a smaller
                    area. Eventually you will be able to "see" the whole posture.)</p>

                <p>Every time you focus on the posture, simultaneously label it with a mental note. Keep noting
                    "sitting," "sitting," "sitting," from one moment to the next, over and over. Remember, it's a light
                    touch-and-go. You don't need to explore the details of the sensation.</p>

                <p>A reminder: don't look at the body with your eyes. Look with your mind.</p>

                <p>As Achan Sobin suggests, it may help to think of the mind as a camera taking a series of snapshots.
                    Take a "shot" of the sitting posture. Then take another snapshot of the same thing.</p>

                <p>Further, when a photographer adjusts a camera lens, he focuses on one spot only; but the entire image
                    comes out clear, not just the particular spot he was focusing on. (This is similar to focusing only
                    on your hands instead of on the whole sitting posture).</p>

                <p>A few paragraphs back we spoke about letting go after observing the sitting posture. Think of a chain
                    of individual acts of focusing, and letting go after each one. In other words, what you should do
                    is: Focus on the object and then forget it. Then immediately focus and forget it again. And again.
                    And so on.</p>

                <p>That's how we explain it in words. But in actual practice the "forgetting" or "letting go" is not a
                    separate action. Letting go of the previous moment happens by itself every time the mind focuses on
                    the posture again. So really it's a matter of: <em>focus, focus, focus</em>, in a series of moments.
                    The meditator keeps taking consecutive "snapshots" of the posture, each one lasting roughly a couple
                    of seconds.</p>

                <p>Some reminders: don't mentally review your body one piece at a time. That would take too long and
                    would pull the mind out of the present moment. And even though you use the mental label "sitting,"
                    remember to focus on the actual posture, not the word itself.</p>

                <p>Every moment of our lives has two components: an object of awareness, and the mind. In this
                    meditation exercise, the object of awareness is the sitting posture. So we have only: the sitting
                    posture (material form) and the thing that is knowing it (the mind). The mind itself cannot adopt a
                    posture. The mind doesn't have buttocks or legs to sit or stand with. It can only <em>be aware
                        of</em> the body's posture.</p>

                <p>There are a couple of Pali words worth remembering, because you will hear them over and over again in
                    discussions about vipassana meditation. They are: "rupa" and "nama." Among other things, rupa means
                    material form. Nama means the mind. In summary: the sitting posture is material form (rupa). The
                    mind (nama) knows&mdash;<em>is aware of</em>&mdash;the form.</p>

                <p>In conventional terms, we say "<em>I </em>am sitting." But in truth, a "self" cannot sit. The body is
                    not a self. It is not <em>your self</em> sitting there. It is only matter, or rupa, sitting. And
                    when the body sits, the mind experiences the posture as a group of temporary sensations, different
                    from when the body is standing or lying down. That is the only way in which posture is experienced.
                </p>

                <p>Everything we've said about observing the sitting posture applies to all the other bodily postures as
                    well.</p>

                <p>Intermediate or advanced meditators may practice this exercise for the entire meditation period, or
                    for a few minutes before practicing the rising-falling exercise. Beginners may do the latter.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">If Strong Emotions Arise</a></p>

                <p>It is natural that strong emotions may sometimes come up during meditation. If that happens, don't
                    assume you are practicing incorrectly. Emotions are valid meditation objects, too, objects of the
                    fourth foundation of mindfulness. As objects of the mind they have no more nor less importance than
                    bodily movement or posture. They are, however, more challenging to observe.</p>

                <p>When an unpleasant emotion such as anger arises, don't get upset or try to suppress it. Nor should
                    you try to look for a "better" object. The emotion is the truth of what is happening in the present,
                    so just be aware of it.</p>

                <p>As soon as you're aware of an emotion during meditation practice, label it with a mental note. For
                    example, if you realize you're angry, label the emotion "anger, anger," for one or two moments. If
                    you're depressed, note "depression"; if anxious, note "anxiety." Do the same with pleasant emotions:
                    if you feel joyful, note "joy"; if peaceful, note "peace." You get the picture.</p>

                <p>The insight meditation method is a middle path between 1) suppressing an emotion and 2) indulging it
                    by expressing it in words or actions, trying to feel it more deeply, or thinking about it further.
                    Whether an emotion is pleasant or unpleasant, the vipassana technique is simply to know it with
                    impartial awareness, neither liking it nor wanting to make it go away. (Note: we are talking about
                    during meditation. In daily life when expressing an emotion a meditator would do so with clear
                    awareness, avoiding harmful speech or behavior.)</p>

                <p>Don't judge the emotion or your self. If you're suddenly furious at someone, don't criticize yourself
                    for getting angry. Instead, try to disengage the mind from any involvement in the anger and just
                    watch it, as if you were watching it happen to someone on television, or viewing it under a
                    microscope. As one teacher says, "<em>See </em>it, don't <em>be</em> it."</p>

                <p>After noting the emotion for one or two moments, let go of it and gently bring your attention back to
                    the primary meditation object. If the emotion is still so strong you can't focus on the primary
                    object, repeat the procedure, noting the emotion longer if necessary. As soon as you can, return to
                    observing the primary meditation object. Over time this method weakens anger, fear, depression,
                    etc., since you are not "feeding" them with your thoughts and reactions. If you acknowledge an
                    emotion when it appears but don't get hooked by it&mdash;don't get upset or intrigued&mdash;the
                    emotion will gradually fade out.</p>

                <p>A fire reflected in a lake cannot burn the water. Neither can emotions disturb the mind when you
                    don’t get involved in them.</p>

                <p>Don’t identify an emotion as your self. The fear or anger is not you, but only an impersonal
                    phenomenon. Mentally pull back from the emotion and turn your awareness around to observe it. Now
                    the emotion is just another object of your attention. Instead of "becoming" the emotion by getting
                    caught up in it, you're looking at it from the outside.</p>

                <p>When we're in the grip of a negative emotion we tend to believe it will never end. But emotions are
                    no more permanent than thoughts. With continued practice you’ll find that you only have to wait and
                    any emotion, whether pleasant or unpleasant, is bound to change.</p>

                <p>In training the mind to know emotions as they really are, a meditator comes to realize that even
                    strong grief, anger or fear can last only a moment before passing away. The emotion might come back;
                    but even so it instantly passes away again.</p>

                <p>An emotion is not something that belongs to you. The anger, sadness, or peace is only an impersonal
                    phenomenon, a kind of mental weather that arises according to certain causes and then vanishes.</p>

                <p>When you're able to separate your awareness from an emotion&mdash;able to leave the anger or sadness
                    alone and become the observer&mdash;the emotion has no power to control you or cause suffering. The
                    key is to be mindful as soon as it appears so you don't get hooked in the early stages.</p>

                <p>But sometimes beginners are so overwhelmed by painful emotion they cannot practice effectively. In
                    that case one of the following methods may help:</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Press the fist against the center of the chest (around the heart area) and repeat "knowing,
                        knowing, knowing," being aware of the sensation of pressure from your hand. Keep this up until
                        the emotion subsides.
                    </li>

                    <li>If you're sitting, get up and practice walking meditation.</li>

                    <li>Temporarily switch to a concentration technique until you are able to resume vipassana practice.
                        For example, you might repeat the word "Buddho," or another mantra (a mantra is a special word
                        or phrase repeated aloud and focused on in concentration meditation).
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <p>Use the last method only when mindfulness is truly unable to cope with a strong emotion. Switching to
                    a concentration technique should <em>not</em> be used as a means of avoiding unpleasant emotions.
                    Sooner or later, mindfulness must learn how to handle emotional objects or we won't be able to make
                    progress in insight.</p>

                <p>In genuine vipassana practice we cannot avoid experiencing unpleasant emotions such as boredom,
                    loneliness, fear, jealousy, anger, and so on. But much is learned from observing them mindfully, and
                    gradually we're able to let go of them sooner. Whenever these emotions <em>do </em>arise they are
                    weaker than they used to be, causing less and less suffering.</p>

                <p>Pleasant emotions should also be known impartially, without liking or becoming attached to them.
                    They, too, are impermanent. If we try to make a pleasant emotion last longer it will become a cause
                    of frustration and unhappiness when, inevitably, it changes. Suffering results when we try to hold
                    on to something that by its very nature cannot endure.</p>

                <p>Most painful emotions arise from memory&mdash;hence the value of staying in the present moment. When
                    recalling a painful memory&mdash;whether it be of a broken heart, or the loss of home, health,
                    career, or loved one&mdash;the unpleasant event that triggered the feeling is no longer actually
                    occurring in the present. Although the event is over the mind clings to it, which generates more
                    suffering.</p>

                <p>Or sometimes we worry about the future, fearing the loss of wealth, youth, or health that hasn't yet
                    occurred. But none of these imaginings is real in the sense that none is <em>actually happening</em>
                    at the moment we are thinking about it.</p>

                <p>The painful events that happened in the past do not exist now. What might or might not happen in the
                    future does not exist right now, either. Why should we let the mind drag us into unnecessary
                    suffering?</p>

                <p>It is not wrong to plan intelligently for the future, of course. But there's a difference between
                    behaving responsibly&mdash;doing what needs to be done&mdash;and needlessly <em>suffering</em> over
                    things that may never happen or are already gone; things which, in any case, we cannot control.
                    Suffering about past or future events can only arise when we fail to stay in the present. So don't
                    fast-forward or rewind.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Letting Go of "I"</a></p>

                <p>In the previous section we explained that an emotion is not your self. Here we will talk a little
                    more about not identifying objects as self.</p>

                <p>Normally, the mind relates everything we experience in everyday life to a concept of selfhood. If we
                    feel a pain in the body, for example, we automatically think, "<em>my </em>back hurts" or
                    "<em>my </em>leg hurts." The painful body part is immediately identified as belonging to "me."</p>

                <p>Although the false belief in self can’t be willed away, in vipassana practice we try to stop
                    reinforcing it so that clear-seeing might arise naturally. We try to observe our bodies and minds
                    without automatically identifying them as self, or as things that are part of us or belong to us.
                    The aim is to let go of the feeling of "I" as much as possible and merely know the bare, phenomenal
                    experience of each moment as it is.</p>

                <p>During meditation practice, instead of: "<em>I </em>am moving," "<em>I </em>am hearing," "<em>I</em>
                    am thinking," and so on, simply be aware of: <em>moving, hearing, thinking.</em> There's no need to
                    mix the "I" into these experiences. In truth, there is no permanent agent executing the actions.</p>

                <p>Try to separate your awareness and watch the mind-body process as if it had nothing at all to do with
                    you. If there's a pain in your back or leg, label the sensation with the mental note "pain" or
                    "feeling," without regarding it as "me" or linking it to a specific body part. When thoughts come,
                    don't assume they are yours (but that's not to say they are someone else's. They don't belong to
                    anyone). The Buddha taught there is thinking, but no thinker (the "knower" of the thoughts is only a
                    momentary awareness that does not equal a self). Apply the same principle to all the other
                    meditation objects. In truth, none of them truly belongs to you.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Sleepiness</a></p>

                <p>Sleepiness may bother you more during an intensive meditation retreat than in your daily practice.
                    Nevertheless, it can be a frequent hindrance for beginners. Just be aware that sleepiness is present
                    whenever it arises. You can mentally note it as "sleepiness." If it does not disperse after repeated
                    noting, try some skillful antidotes: 1) open your eyes; 2) do walking meditation; 3) turn up the
                    lights, or 4) splash your face with cold water. Cooling the room may also help. An excess of
                    concentration can cause sleepiness. Be careful to follow the meditation techniques correctly so that
                    mindfulness and concentration stay as balanced as possible.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">How to Observe Objects</a></p>

                <p>It is important to understand what counts as a correct object for mindfulness. As we explained in
                    "What is Vipassana?" the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are the appropriate objects for insight
                    meditation. Once again, these are:</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>The body: i.e., bodily motion and posture.</li>

                    <li>Feelings: painful, pleasant and neutral feelings (these don't refer to emotions).</li>

                    <li>Consciousness: for example, the condition of the mind with or without hatred, delusion, etc.
                    </li>

                    <li>Dhamma objects: this group includes the five mental hindrances: lust, anger, sleepiness,
                        restlessness, and doubt, as well as the five sense-impressions: sights, sounds, tastes, smells,
                        and touches. Some objects in this group are mental, some, material.
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <p>Reduced to their essentials, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are simply material phenomena (rupa)
                    and mental phenomena (nama). But this might sound as if anything whatsoever can be a valid object
                    for mindfulness. Not quite.</p>

                <p>A valid object for mindfulness must be something that actually exists, and is directly perceived in
                    the present moment. It isn't something that used to exist, or will exist in the future. As Ven.
                    Sujìva points out, it isn't imaginary, conceptual, or remembered. Nor is it a name or a word.</p>

                <p>Let's talk for a moment about mental phenomena, since these are the hardest to understand. In the
                    context of vipassana meditation, some mental forms are "real," such as the intention to move the
                    body, or a feeling of aversion or desire. They are valid objects of mindfulness if we observe them
                    at the very moment in which they arise (instead of remembering them afterwards). Mental phenomena
                    that are not real in the same sense are names, words, memories and fantasies.</p>

                <p>But we should understand that during vipassana practice we won't always be able to focus on a "real"
                    or "correct" meditation object, even if we try hard to do so. Sometimes we'll get lost in memories,
                    or find ourselves planning what we're going to do the next day. We might realize we've been focusing
                    on a word instead of on the actual phenomenon being experienced. At times the mind will get caught
                    up in imaginary constructs. That's to be expected, and it's all right. We shouldn't get upset when
                    it happens. As soon as we're aware, we can begin again from that point. All we need to do is label
                    the event with an appropriate mental note, such as "memory," "planning," or "imagining," and lightly
                    bring the mind back to the main meditation object.</p>

                <p>In daily life our minds become obsessed with some forms and try to get rid of others. Inevitably we
                    like good feelings, beautiful sights, pleasant sounds, delicious tastes, and fragrant smells, and
                    dislike unpleasant ones. Partiality reigns. Yet vipassana is the ultimate democratic technique.
                    Whether good or bad in conventional terms, all objects are treated equally during meditation
                    practice.</p>

                <p>But it's not enough just to know which objects to observe. Having identified the appropriate
                    meditation objects, we need to understand precisely <em>how </em>to observe them.</p>

                <p>The way of focusing on objects in vipassana practice differs from that of concentration meditation,
                    and it's important to understand the difference. In every present moment, the mind makes contact
                    with, or <em>knows</em>, an object. In other words, the mind, the knower, experiences an object.</p>

                <p>In order to have a complete foundation for mindfulness, a meditator observes both the mind and its
                    object in each moment. (But that doesn't mean observing two <em>objects </em>at the same time. As we
                    said earlier, a meditator observes only one object at a time.)</p>

                <p>Put another way, a meditator observes the knowing. Or we could say, he observes: <em>the mind in the
                    act of knowing the object. </em>It isn't as complicated as it sounds. As soon as we're aware of <em>knowing </em>an
                    object, we'll automatically be aware of the object, too. Consciousness can't know itself. It has to
                    have something outside itself to be aware <em>of. </em>The act of knowing cannot happen without some
                    object "x" to be known.</p>

                <p>So when we say, for example, "be aware of the rising motion," what should be observed is, "knowing
                    rising," or "the-act-of-knowing-rising." That is true for all meditation objects, not just the
                    abdominal movements. The complete unit of observation is always "the-mind-knowing-<em>x</em>" or
                    simply, "knowing <em>x</em>."</p>

                <p>There is another important aspect to observing objects in insight meditation. Every object we observe
                    during vipassana practice arises, persists, and then ends, and this entire development occurs within
                    one moment. This can be illustrated by a single step of the foot in basic walking meditation. Every
                    step has a clear beginning as you lift the heel, a middle phase as the foot travels forward, and an
                    end as you place the foot down (these three phases segue into each other fluidly). The entire
                    progression happens in one moment, and our attention should be sustained through the whole arc, from
                    the instant of lifting the heel all the way to the end. After the movement ends we let it go and
                    focus on the beginning of the next object. If we want to keep walking, we would observe the
                    beginning of the next step.</p>

                <p>Although not all meditation objects will have such clearly distinct phases as a single step does, we
                    can use this example as a paradigm of how to observe other objects, too, even mental events. Even
                    though we won't be able to do it clearly at first, our eventual aim during meditation should be to
                    observe every object in this manner, knowing it with mindfulness from the instant of its arising all
                    the way through to its ending, right in the present moment. But remember, the cycle of development
                    we're speaking about occurs within a single moment, a single instance of noticing, not across
                    several moments. So the duration of the whole process is very short&mdash;no more than two or three
                    seconds, sometimes much less. If you're a beginner, this will probably sound quite puzzling. Please
                    don't worry. As you gain experience practicing meditation the meaning will gradually become clear.
                    This is one of many aspects of meditation that only truly becomes clear with practical experience.
                    But having an intellectual understanding beforehand can help point you in the right direction.</p>

                <p>To summarize how to observe objects in vipassana practice, we should: 1) observe realities, not
                    concepts or names; 2) be aware of <em>knowing </em>each object; and 3) observe each object from
                    beginning to end as it arises and disappears in the present moment.</p>

                <div class="line">&nbsp;</div>

                <a name="x"></a>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Momentary Knowing</a></p>

                <p>In insight meditation, objects should be observed momentarily. What does "momentarily" mean? During
                    meditation you should let go of an object after focusing on it once. In other words, after observing
                    something for one moment, mentally let it go and then move on to the next object (the "next object"
                    might be a completely different form, or it could be the same thing again if it's still occurring,
                    like a feeling of itchiness lasting a few minutes). An insight meditator focuses moment-by-moment.
                    As we said before, the motto is: "Focus and forget it," or "know and let go."</p>

                <p>Please don't misunderstand: we <em>don't</em> mean you have to change to a different meditation
                    object every single moment. Don't worry if you're a little confused at this point. We'll explain
                    further.</p>

                <p>Some meditation objects only last a few seconds. Take the exercise of watching the rising and falling
                    movements, for example. We watch the abdomen rise, and then the rising movement ends, only to be
                    immediately replaced by the falling movement, which is a different object.</p>

                <p>Even if you want to observe the rising movement longer, you can't, because it doesn't last more than
                    a couple of seconds. After watching it for a moment you have to change to observing the falling
                    movement. And then after a couple of seconds the falling movement changes to rising. And so on.
                    That's why you can't observe the rising movement or the falling movement longer than one moment at a
                    time.</p>

                <p>But what if you're watching a meditation object that stays the same for a longer time? How would you
                    observe it from moment-to-moment? Let's take the example of sound. Imagine that while observing the
                    abdominal movements you're distracted by the sound of a car alarm going off in the street below. The
                    noise continues for at least five minutes. You would observe hearing the sound for one moment, and
                    then drop it. But since the sound would still be happening, you would observe the same sound a
                    second time, letting it go again&mdash;and so on, in a series of acts of knowing. (Note: that
                    doesn't mean you <em>have </em>to keep observing the sound until it’s over. If the sound no longer
                    disturbs your mind after noting it once or twice, there'd be no reason to continue focusing on it.
                    You could then return to watching the abdominal movements).</p>

                <p>The same thing applies to the other meditation objects. Students sometimes get confused because we
                    say a meditation exercise such as the sitting posture can be practiced as long as forty-five
                    minutes. In that case, wouldn't a person focus on the sitting posture for the entire meditation
                    period?</p>

                <p>In ordinary terms, yes. But again, we need to understand how to focus from moment to moment during
                    vipassana practice. Although for the sake of communication we can talk about observing the sitting
                    posture for three-quarters of an hour, what we are actually doing during that time is knowing
                    sitting for a moment and letting it go, knowing sitting and letting go, knowing and letting go, over
                    and over again. It's the same as in the example of the car alarm. Each instance of focusing lasts
                    only a moment. During those 45 minutes many individual acts of noticing occur, and the mind starts
                    over again with each one. Furthermore, in between moments of knowing the sitting posture there may
                    be times when we notice a secondary object such as a thought, a sound, or an itch, whenever those
                    things pull our attention away. During a single meditation session mindfulness may jump back and
                    forth from one object to another many times.</p>

                <p>Most of us have seen jugglers at festivals or street fairs, and their touch-and-go skill is a perfect
                    example of how to focus on objects in meditation. A juggler has to concentrate in order to catch
                    each ball as it comes around. He can't let himself get distracted by a noise in the crowd or allow
                    his gaze wander. He must know where to put his attention, and then keep his mind on that spot.
                    Likewise, a meditator has to concentrate or he will get distracted from whatever object is appearing
                    in the present moment. That's the "focus" part of the equation.</p>

                <p>Now for the "forget it" part: as soon as a juggler catches one ball he lets it go immediately or his
                    hand won't be free to catch the next one. He keeps his attention moving, "jumping" from one object
                    to the next. In the same way, as soon a meditator notes an object he drops it, or else he'll miss
                    the next present moment. His attention doesn't cling to anything. Like the juggler's, his experience
                    is <em>touch-and-go, touch-and-go</em>.</p>

                <p>In the ultimate sense, reality is a series of different phenomena coming into being and dying out one
                    after another, very fast. For that reason our attention has to keep moving to the next thing in
                    order to keep up. Mindfulness is always moving to know the next object that appears. It drops the
                    last moment in order to know what is arising in the <em>next </em>present moment.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Exercise 5: Sitting-Touching</a></p>

                <p>In this exercise your attention switches back and forth between two primary meditation objects. The
                    first object is the sitting posture itself, as described above.</p>

                <p>For the second object, find a point on your right or left buttock where you can feel the contact of
                    the floor. That will be the touching point. The idea is to "touch" this spot with your mind&mdash;i.e.,
                    to bring your awareness to focus on that point, momentarily. During this exercise ignore the
                    rising-falling motions.</p>

                <p>Adopt one of the sitting postures. As described above, observe the sitting posture for one moment,
                    focusing, if you wish, on your hands in your lap. In the next moment move your mind to the touch
                    point and observe the contact. (Note: we are referring to mental contact, not physical&mdash;the
                    contact of the mind "touching" the point.) Your attention will "jump" from the sitting posture to
                    the touch-point.</p>

                <p>Keep alternating between them from one moment to the next, noting, "<em>sitting, touching, sitting,
                    touching, sitting, touching.</em>" Focus on each object approximately the same length of time&mdash;about
                    one-and-a-half to three seconds, or roughly as long as it takes to say the mental note. (Another way
                    to think of it is: focus on sitting for roughly the duration of one rising motion of the abdomen.
                    The same with touching.) Don't try to be precise about the length of each moment. Just observe the
                    posture for as long as it takes to say "sitting" a little more slowly than normal and you'll be
                    fine. That is one moment. Then note the touch point for about the same length of time, saying
                    "touching." And back to knowing sitting again, one time. Then touching, for one moment. Back and
                    forth. Practice this exercise anywhere from twenty minutes to one hour.</p>

                <p>During a meditation retreat, observe the touch point on the right side of the body for one meditation
                    session and the left side the next, alternating sides throughout the day. In your regular daily
                    practice you can do the left side one day, the right side the next.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Exercise 6: Rising-Falling-Sitting</a></p>

                <p>Once you feel comfortable with the rising-falling and sitting-touching exercises individually, you
                    can begin to combine them as in this exercise. Like a juggler adding another ball, you add a third
                    object to give mindfulness more "work" to do. If you have noticed a pronounced gap between the
                    rising and falling movements in Exercise 1, you're ready to add "sitting." (But that doesn't mean
                    you have to practice this exercise all the time from now on. Even advanced meditators still use
                    Exercise 1 as their main meditation exercise).</p>

                <p>Adopt one of the sitting postures. Observe one rising and one falling motion of the abdomen. Before
                    breathing in again, focus on the sitting posture for one moment, taking a mental "snapshot" of the
                    pose. Eventually the duration of these three moments should be roughly equal, but when first
                    learning the exercise they are often uneven. That's all right,&nbsp;as long as&nbsp;none of the
                    moments is&nbsp;longer than about three seconds. (Note that sitting is observed in between falling
                    and rising, so do not breathe in while observing sitting.)</p>

                <p>After observing the sitting posture one time, start over with rising again. Keep going in sequence:
                    <em>rising, falling, sitting; rising, falling, sitting</em>. Use the corresponding mental notes:
                    "rising," "falling," "sitting."</p>

                <p>At first you might have to hold your breath for a moment in order to fit the sitting object between
                    the old falling and the new rising motion. But with practice there will be a natural space long
                    enough in which to observe the posture. Practice this exercise for a minimum of twenty minutes,
                    working up to forty-five minutes or one hour.</p>

                <p>Once you feel comfortable with exercises five and six you can add a fourth object, combining the
                    rising-falling and sitting-touching exercises. Adopt one of the sitting postures. Observe one rising
                    and one falling motion of the abdomen. Before breathing in again, observe the sitting posture for
                    one moment. Then (also before breathing in) focus on the touch point at the buttocks. In total there
                    are four objects observed in sequence: 1) rising, 2) falling, 3) sitting, 4) touching. These should
                    be of roughly equal duration. Do not breathe while observing sitting and touching. After you note
                    touching, start over with rising again.</p>

                <p>Continue the sequence, using the mental notes "rising," "falling," "sitting," "touching," if you
                    wish. Observe each object for about&nbsp;one-and-a-half to three seconds each time (or about as long
                    as the duration of one rising motion). At first, as in Exercise 6, you may have to hold your breath
                    slightly in order to fit sitting and touching between the falling and rising motions. But with
                    practice, conditions will balance by themselves and you will be able to fit in all four objects
                    without having to consciously adjust your breathing.</p>

                    <span class="subtext">(Suitable for beginners if practiced a short time only, or when ill)</span>
                </p>

                <p>During a meditation retreat, when devoting the entire day to vipassana, it's important to practice in
                    all four postures: sitting, walking, standing, and lying down. Not that you should spend equal time
                    in each pose. Typically, sitting and walking are practiced anywhere from thirty to sixty minutes at
                    a time, standing and lying down, from five to fifteen.</p>

                <p>Only an advanced meditator can practice lying down for long periods without getting sleepy or losing
                    mindfulness. And although standing can be practiced longer, it's usually too uncomfortable for the
                    novice to maintain for long periods.</p>

                <p>In the beginning, therefore, unless you are ill, do not exceed the fifteen-minute maximum for lying
                    down. Change into the reclining pose slowly and mindfully, following the step-by-step technique of
                    stopping between movements.</p>

                <p>As you change from standing to lying down, note each small action: observe the sensation of contact
                    as you bend each knee to the floor and lower the torso. Move the legs one at a time, placing one on
                    top of the other. Note the contact there, too. Label these actions with the word "moving."</p>

                <p>Lie on your side, with the arm closest to the floor extended under your head or on the floor in front
                    of the chest, the uppermost arm resting against the side of the body. (You may place a pillow under
                    your head).</p>

                <p>Now observe the lying down posture, taking repeated mental snapshots, as with sitting. As you do so,
                    note "lying" or "lying down." Ignore the rising-falling motions.</p>

                <p>For a more detailed explanation of how to observe bodily posture, please see Exercise 4.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, instead of the posture itself you can observe the rising and falling abdominal
                    movements (but do not also watch the posture. Choose one or the other). You can also practice the
                    hand motions exercise while lying on your back. In that case, ignore the posture and abdominal
                    movements and observe only the movement of the hands.</p>

                </p>

                <p>As with sitting and lying down, the meditation object here is the posture itself. You might want to
                    practice this exercise for five, ten or fifteen minutes before doing walking meditation. Stand
                    straight with the arms held in front of the body, one hand clasping the wrist of the other; or clasp
                    the hands behind your back.</p>

                <p>Your eyes may be open or closed. If you open your eyes, don't pay attention to what you're seeing.
                    Let your attention stay with the kinesthetic "feel" of the posture. If you wish, you may focus on
                    one area of the body, such as the soles of your feet. Now take a mental "snapshot" of the posture,
                    noting "standing." Ignore the rising-falling motions. Just keep observing standing, being aware of
                    knowing the posture from moment-to-moment.</p>

                <p>For a more detailed explanation of how to observe posture, please see Exercise 4.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">If You Experience Bliss</a></p>

                <p>Some students experience strong feelings of rapture, peace or bliss at a certain stage in meditation
                    practice. If this happens to you, don't get excited. Just note the bliss or peace as you would any
                    other object. Don't cling to the feeling (but neither should you try to avoid it). Like everything
                    else, blissful or peaceful feelings should be known with impartial attention. Then let them go.</p>

                <p>As one teacher cautions, meditators who fail to notice pleasant feelings impartially, thinking,
                    "'After all, these are good things,' will ultimately find themselves in difficult straits, unable to
                    advance in meditation." (Ven. Mahathera Matara,<em> The Seven Stages of Purification</em>, p. 39).
                </p>

                <p>There's nothing wrong with good feelings; but it's their nature to pass away. Trying to make them
                    last will only disturb your mind and prevent you from gaining the higher levels of insight.</p>

                <p>Even if the bliss is stronger than any happiness you've ever known, you shouldn't mistake it for
                    enlightenment, or even an advanced level of insight. Generally speaking, blissful feelings arise at
                    a relatively early stage in vipassana practice. The peace that comes from maturing insight, which is
                    independent of the presence or absence of <em>pleasant feeling</em> (sukha vedana), is quite
                    different from the blissful states that may occur in the earlier stages of vipassana-knowledge. The
                    latter are temporary, pleasurable feelings which alternate with neutral or unpleasant feelings. When
                    the pleasant feeling ends the meditator may be unhappy or irritated because he wants to have the
                    feeling again. But a highly experienced vipassana meditator is able to transcend attachment to
                    feeling so as to be free and perfectly content no matter what kinds of sensations are present, even
                    unpleasant ones. The remarkable freedom and ease of nonattachment are superior to the happiness of
                    pleasant feelings that arise and pass away.</p>

                <div class="line">&nbsp;</div>

                <a name="ee"></a>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Desire is Not Your Guide</a></p>

                <p>Be aware that a pleasant feeling during vipassana meditation doesn't necessarily mean you are
                    practicing correctly (nor does an unpleasant feeling mean the opposite). Good or bad feelings are
                    not reliable guides in insight meditation. Neither are your moods and desires. The important thing
                    is whether mindfulness can know and let go of <em>whatever</em> is happening in the present moment,
                    be it good or bad, even if the "thing going on" is anger, anxiety, pain, or another unpleasant
                    state.</p>

                <p>Your ability to simply be aware, with equanimity, of whatever is happening now, is the yardstick by
                    which to judge your practice. So don't become self-satisfied if you feel blissful, or discouraged if
                    your meditation is uncomfortable. Just ask yourself, "Am I aware of what is going on from moment to
                    moment, whether good or bad, and letting it go, without clinging to it or feeling aversion?" If the
                    answer is yes, be assured you are getting benefit that will increase day by day.</p>

                <p>But some people, when angry or worried, say, "I'm too upset to meditate right now." They think we
                    should wait to practice vipassana until after the mind has calmed down. That's like a patient with a
                    life-threatening infection claiming he is too sick to take medicine. He'll take it after the
                    infection is gone. By that time, of course, he wouldn't need it, having died already. Vipassana
                    practice is medicine for the mind. If our minds were <em>already</em> calm and free of delusion, we
                    wouldn't need it.</p>

                <p>Although there will be days when you won't want to meditate, don't give in to your moods and practice
                    only when you feel like it. Vipassana should be regarded as something necessary, as essential as
                    taking medicine when we are sick, or brushing our teeth every day. We don't do those things because
                    they are great fun, but in order to keep the body healthy. Meditation makes the mind healthy. There
                    is only one time to do it: today.</p>

                <p>As with any other skill, progress in vipassana meditation requires self-discipline. It's no different
                    from excelling in a sport or playing a musical instrument. No one would expect to become a concert
                    pianist, for example, if he only practiced the piano when he really felt like it.</p>

                <p>Perhaps you feel peaceful when doing sitting meditation, but not when doing the walking exercise. You
                    might decide to give up walking because it doesn't "work" for you. Or perhaps you sit down to
                    meditate for forty-five minutes, but after a quarter of an hour you switch to a different technique
                    because you feel bored. "Maybe the other exercise will make me feel peaceful or happy," you think.
                    The grass always looks greener, doesn't it?</p>

                <p>We're not implying you need to practice every exercise on this website, or always meditate forty-five
                    minutes. The point is to be scrupulously honest with yourself and let intelligence, instead of your
                    momentary desires and moods, guide your decisions. Don't allow desire to control your meditation
                    practice.</p>

                <p>But how should you decide which exercises to practice? Although occasionally it's good to try a new
                    exercise as a way of testing mindfulness, for the most part you should stick with the exercise(s) in
                    which mindfulness is able to observe the meditation object most clearly. If you practice the more
                    advanced exercises before you're ready, you'll only become frustrated and won't progress as quickly.
                    Mindfulness has to build up gradually. As we said before, beginners are encouraged to start with the
                    rising and falling and/or the hand motions exercises. They can also practice the basic walking step,
                    and some of the other exercises for short amounts of time as noted.</p>

                        class="subtext">(Optional)</span></p>

                <p>In the Buddhist tradition it is customary to pay respect to the Buddha and his teachings at the start
                    of each meditation session. Non-Buddhists may skip this step.</p>

                <p>The instructions for paying respect are as follows. (These movements should be performed slowly and
                    mindfully):</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Begin with hands on the knees, palms facing downward.</li>

                    <li>Slowly rotate the right hand laterally (to your right) until it is resting on edge,
                        perpendicular to the knee. There should be no space between the fingers. Stop completely for a
                        moment.
                    </li>

                    <li>Raise your hand straight up about seven or eight inches. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Without changing its position relative to the arm, slowly move your hand toward the midline of
                        the body until it's in front of the chest. Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Move the left hand as you did the right. Rotate it laterally (to your left) until it's
                        perpendicular on the knee. Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Raise the left hand straight up about seven or eight inches. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Bring the left hand toward the midline of the body, until it's in front of the chest. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Press the palms together, fingertips pointing to the ceiling. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Bend the head in a small bow, thinking, "May I pay respect to the Buddha (wisdom), the Dhamma
                        (ultimate reality), and the sangha (the company of enlightened beings)." Or devise your own
                        phrase to express something like this: "May I pay respect to the teachings and the teachers of
                        vipassana meditation, beginning with the Buddha himself."
                    </li>

                    <li>Now you will repeat the above motions in reverse order (with one small difference). Raise your
                        head. Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Move the right hand back out until it's poised over the knee. The hand is still perpendicular.
                        Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Lower the hand until it's an inch or so above the knee. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Bring the right hand straight down until the lateral side of the little finger touches the knee.
                        Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Rotate the hand medially until the palm is resting on the knee. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Repeat steps 11-14 with the left hand, making sure to stop after each movement.</li>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">The Moral Precepts</a></p>

                <p>The way to be free of suffering, the Buddha said, is to develop ourselves in three areas: morality,
                    concentration, and wisdom. The last two aspects are addressed by meditation practice. But these in
                    turn rest on a foundation of morality.</p>

                <p>Without some degree of restraint in our behavior, the mind will be too troubled to concentrate and
                    meditate effectively. By adhering to a code of wholesome behavior, however, meditation practice will
                    progress smoothly.</p>

                <p>Morality, called "sila" in Pali, is addressed by the precepts. The following five precepts are the
                    Buddhist guidelines for the layperson. We encourage everyone to follow them. Note that the fifth
                    precept is to abstain from alcohol. That doesn't mean you cannot practice vipassana meditation
                    unless you give up drinking. You might begin by following the first four precepts while gradually
                    decreasing your alcohol intake. You could add the last precept whenever you felt ready. The reason
                    for this precept is to avoid the loss of mindfulness leading to unwholesome speech and behavior
                    which often occurs with drunkenness and recreational-drug use.</p>

                <p>The precepts below are given in Pali first, then English, but it's fine to say them in English only.
                    If you wish you can repeat these precepts aloud every morning while concentrating on them with your
                    eyes closed. If you happen to break a precept, take all five precepts over again. And be sure to
                    forgive yourself. Nobody's perfect.</p>

                <p class="subhd">The Five Precepts</p>

                <ol>

                    <li><em>Panatipata veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami.</em> I take the precept to refrain from killing
                        any creature (including insects).
                    </li>

                    <li><em>Adinnadana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami.</em> I take the precept to refrain from
                        stealing.
                    </li>

                    <li><em>Kamesu micchacara veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami.</em> I take the precept to refrain from
                        sexual misconduct (i.e., sexual relations with someone other than my spouse, or with a married,
                        engaged, underage person, etc.). Any sexual action that hurts another can be considered sexual
                        misconduct.
                    </li>

                    <li><em>Musavada veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami.</em> I take the precept to refrain from lying and
                        harmful speech (the latter includes harsh speech, gossip, and idle chatter).
                    </li>

                    <li><em>Surameraya majja pamadatthana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami.</em> I take the precept to
                        refrain from consuming alcohol and using recreational drugs, which lead to carelessness. (This
                        does not include drugs used as medicine.)
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <p>Meditators usually take the eight precepts during vipassana retreats. You can also take them on
                    so-called uposatha days (days of the half, full or quarter moon), weekends, or any time you
                    choose.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">A Natural Method?</a></p>

                <p>Unlike some types of meditation, in vipassana we don't focus on a special object like a candle flame
                    or a colored disc. No external props are used. Our own bodies and minds provide all the meditation
                    objects needed. And since vipassana can be done while moving the body, advanced students can
                    practice mindfulness anywhere, under any circumstances, not only during formal meditation sessions.
                    (However, mindfulness in daily life differs in some ways from the mindfulness of formal meditation
                    practice. For an explanation, please see the section, "Mindfulness in Daily Life" at the end of this
                    article.)</p>

                <p>Based on the idea that vipassana is a more natural practice than other types of meditation (since
                    mindfulness can be applied at any time), some students develop wrong ideas and expectations about
                    it. For example, some meditators dislike the hand motions and advanced walking exercises on the
                    grounds they are not "natural" enough. This is to become too attached to a concept of what insight
                    meditation should be. Actually, there is no qualitative difference between a spontaneous movement
                    and the slower, deliberate movements of the hands and feet in the step-by-step vipassana method.
                    Bodily motion has the same properties whenever it appears. But there is an important practical
                    difference: Most beginners gain mindfulness more quickly when observing slower, step-by-step
                    movements, which is why we teach this form of vipassana. Also, it is easier to see the
                    cause-and-effect relationship between mind and body with this method.</p>

                <p>Any form of meditation is merely a technique for training the mind, not an end in itself. When we
                    think about it, there is no such thing as a wholly natural method, because a method is by definition
                    applied deliberately. The most natural technique is still a technique.</p>

                <p>Even with the most natural method, the student doesn't sit back and let nature take its course.
                    Effort must still be made to go against the stream of habit and bring the mind back to the present
                    moment, over and over again. The meditator doesn't use force, but gentle persistence. That
                    persistence is right effort, which is necessary because getting lost in thoughts of the past and
                    future is the most natural thing in the world.</p>

                <p>That said, it can be helpful to practice more naturally at times in order to test mindfulness, as
                    long as we understand this technique correctly and don't cling to it. This method is especially
                    helpful for advanced meditators undertaking intensive retreats. Toward the end of a meditation
                    retreat of several weeks or months, Achan Sobin often tells students to alternate between the
                    step-by-step technique and a more natural way of meditating. When practicing the latter method the
                    student does not adopt a special posture. He sits and walks as he would in daily life, except a
                    little more slowly. The student follows this method for one or more days and then switches to the
                    step-by-step technique. He continues to alternate between the two methods until a high level of
                    insight arises. But again, this back-and-forth approach is usually applied during intensive retreats
                    of all-day meditation, not when only practicing an hour or so per day.</p>

                <p>We do not recommend the natural method for beginners, because their mindfulness and concentration are
                    weak. Most beginning meditators progress more quickly with the step-by-step method.</p>

                <p>The Buddha taught that until we completely eliminate the unwholesome tendencies in our minds any
                    system of mental purification will go against some of our inclinations. Once the mind is fully
                    purified, however, we'll no longer need to meditate. Mindfulness will arise spontaneously. Then
                    we'll truly be able to live naturally without experiencing&mdash;or causing&mdash;any mental
                    suffering.

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Mindful Eating</a></p>

                <p>During an intensive vipassana retreat you should try to maintain mindfulness twenty-four-hours per
                    day, except when sleeping. Do everything slowly. Be as aware as possible during every activity: when
                    walking to the hall, using the bathroom, making your bed, getting dressed, opening a door, brushing
                    your teeth, drinking water, and so on. If you don't maintain continuity of awareness you'll be
                    starting from zero again and again. But mindfulness increases exponentially when it's continuous.
                    That principle applies to mealtimes as well.</p>

                <p>Mindful eating is no less important than sitting meditation, because insight-knowledge can arise at
                    any time. During a meditation retreat, instead of viewing mealtimes as opportunities to take a break
                    and ease up on mindfulness, regard them as golden opportunities for practice. The desire in the mind
                    is often much clearer during meals than at any other time of day. To see desire in action is an
                    important aspect of vipassana meditation.</p>

                <p>Some preliminary instructions for mindful eating: since it takes much longer to eat a meal this way,
                    be sure to allow at least one to two hours. Walk to the table slowly and mindfully. Note any
                    tendency to hurry, induced by the desire for food. If you are carrying a plate, put it on the table
                    before sitting down, noting "placing." Then with the hands clasped in front of the body, stand
                    beside the chair for a moment, noting "standing."</p>

                <p>Next, extend your hand and touch the chair back, being aware of the feeling of contact as your hand
                    touches the chair. Pull the chair out. Move your hand back to your body and clasp the hands together
                    again. Note "intending to sit," and then sit down slowly. Stop moving for a moment, and then scoot
                    your chair toward the table. Adjust the chair until you're comfortable.</p>

                <p>During a meditation retreat it is customary to pay respect before the meal, expressing gratitude for
                    the food. Place your hands in the "respect" position (see "Paying Respect to the Teachings"). Next,
                    say something like this, either silently or aloud: "May this food give me energy to continue
                    practicing mindfulness from moment-to-moment, until I am completely free of suffering. May I share
                    the merit I've gained from meditation practice with the person who prepared this food, and with all
                    beings."</p>

                <p>Then bring your hands back from the "respect" position step-by-step, ending with your palms on your
                    knees. Except for paying respect, meals are conducted in silence during an intensive meditation
                    retreat.</p>

                <p class="subhd">Instructions for Mindful Eating</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>Look at the food, noting "seeing."</li>

                    <li>Notice whether or not you are hungry.</li>

                    <li>Note "intending to move."</li>

                    <li>Turn your right or left hand laterally until it's resting on edge, perpendicular to the knee.
                        Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Raise your hand straight up until it's more or less at table-height. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Move your hand forward toward the fork or spoon. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Grasp the fork, being aware of the sensation of touch as you do so. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Lift the fork. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Move the fork toward the food. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Place a bite of food on the fork. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Slowly raise the fork to your mouth. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Touch the fork to your lips. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Open your mouth. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Put the food in your mouth. Notice the feel of your lips touching the fork, and the contact or
                        temperature of the food on the tongue. Don't let yourself chew yet. Stop.
                    </li>

                    <li>Lower your hand slowly. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Place the fork on your plate. Stop.</li>

                    <li>Return your hand to your knee. (You still haven't begun to chew.)</li>

                    <li>Chew the food. Flavor will appear. Mentally try to isolate the flavor from the tactile mass of
                        the food, the movement of your mouth, and any desire that arises. Flavor is its own object,
                        separate from all these things. If the flavor is strong you should focus on it. But if the
                        flavor is bland, focus on the movement of the jaw or tongue. Note "moving," "tasting," "desire,"
                        "touch," and so on, as appropriate.
                    </li>

                    <li>As you swallow, note "swallowing."</li>

                    <li>Be aware your mouth is empty.</li>

                    <li>Notice whether or not you feel full.</li>

                    <li>Note the intention to take another bite.</li>

                    <li>Repeat steps 1-22. (Although mental notes were not given for all the steps, you may wish to add
                        them, labeling "moving" for steps 3-5 and so on.)
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <p>If you need both hands to cut something, focus your attention on one hand only. Apply the same
                    step-by-step procedure to drinking: observe the intention first; extend your hand; grasp the cup;
                    move the cup toward you; take a sip of water; and finally, bring the cup back to the table, stopping
                    completely after each action.</p>

                <p>When mindfulness and insight are strong you may not recognize what you are eating. This experience is
                    a revelation. Instead of green beans or rice on the plate, you see only color. Rather than meat or
                    cheese, you taste an unnamed burst of sensation. This experience is difficult to describe, but if it
                    happens you will immediately understand what we are talking about.</p>

                <p>The step-by-step eating technique is intended mainly for meditation retreats. During daily life it
                    usually isn't practical to eat this way, except on special days or when you have free time on the
                    weekends. When you are unable to eat in the step-by-step manner just use general mindfulness to be
                    aware of what you are doing as you eat the meal.</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Sharing Merit and Lovingkindness (Metta)</a></p>

                <p>At the end of a meditation retreat it is customary to share "merit" and loving-kindness (metta) with
                    all beings so everyone may benefit from your meditation practice. You can do this after your regular
                    morning or evening meditation, too. Say whatever words seem suitable to you, such as: "May I share
                    the benefit of my vipassana practice with all beings, so they may be free of mental and physical
                    suffering. May all beings be well and happy." Or, with your hands in the "respect" position, you can
                    repeat the traditional Pali sequence, given below.</p>

                <p class="subhd">The Pali Formula for Sharing Lovingkindness:</p>

                <p class="ind">Sabbe satta (sah BAY sah TAH)<br>Avera hontu (AH ver ah hone too)<br>Sabbe satta (sah BAY
                    sah TAH)<br>Abayapajjha hontu (ah bai YAH pah jah hone too)<br>Sabbe satta (sah BAY sah TAH)<br>Anigha
                    hontu (ah nee gah hone too)<br>Sukhi attanam (sook ee ah tah nang)<br>Pariharantu (par ee har ohn
                    too)</p>

                <p><em>Translation: May all beings living in the ten corners of samsara, undergoing the suffering of
                    birth, aging, sickness and death, be happy and free from hatred and anxiety. May they be happy and
                    free from all physical and mental suffering.</em></p>

                <p class="ind">Idham no (ee dam no)<br>Natinam (nah tee nam)<br>Hontu (hone too)<br>Sukhita (sook ee
                    tah)<br>Hontu yatayo (hone too yah tai yo)</p>

                <p><em>Translation: I share this merit with my family. May they be well and happy.</em></p>

                <p class="ind">Idam me (ee dam may)<br>Punna bhagam (puhn yah bah gahm)<br>Sabbha (sah bah)<br>Sattanam
                    (sah tah nam)<br>Demi (day mee)</p>

                <p><em>Translation: I share this merit with all beings. May all beings be well and happy.</em></p>

                <p class="ind">Idam me (ee dam may)<br>Vipassana (vih pah sah nuh)<br>Kusalam (koo sah lahm)<br>Asava
                    (ah sah vah)<br>Khayavaham (kai yah vuh hum)<br>Hotu (Ho too)</p>

                <p><em>Translation: May the merit from my practice of vipassana eliminate the desire, hatred and
                    delusion in my mind.</em></p>

                <p>After saying these words it is traditional to bow three times: first to the Buddha (wisdom), second
                    to the Dhamma (ultimate truth) and third to the sangha (the company of enlightened beings).</p>

                <p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Mindfulness in Daily Life</a></p>

                <p>Many students ask us how to practice vipassana in daily life. In order to understand how to apply
                    mindfulness to our everyday activities we first have to know that in daily life meditators focus on
                    a different type of object than in formal meditation.</p>

                <p>Ideally, the objects of mindfulness during formal meditation are bare sense-data: mere sensations of
                    bodily movement, sound, color, feeling and so forth, without names (the mental notes have a
                    different purpose than the ordinary names of objects, and are only used as a temporary training
                    device). We don't add any descriptions to the pure sensations. Because of this, an advanced
                    meditator may not recognize what he is seeing, hearing, or otherwise experiencing. For example, when
                    hearing a sound he will clearly be aware of the act of hearing, but he won't identify the noise as a
                    barking dog, a motorcycle engine, or whatever it may be in ordinary terms (don't worry: the
                    recognition of sense-perceptions returns as soon as one stops meditating).</p>

                <p>But in daily life we have to be aware of the names of things or we'd be unable to function. It is
                    necessary to recognize and distinguish one sight or sound from another, and apply the correct
                    language to each. We have to know, for instance, that a certain sound signifies a ringing phone, not
                    the call of a bird. And we often have to think in much more complex, abstract ways. Even a simple
                    task like preparing a meal would be impossible when perceiving pure color-patches. When fixing
                    supper we have to distinguish a tomato from a carrot, a knife from a spoon, and so on.</p>

                <p>In addition, during daily life we almost always have to move faster than we do in formal meditation,
                    and so we don't have an opportunity to observe our bodily movements clearly, step-by-step, as in
                    formal meditation practice.</p>

                <p> Most of the time in ordinary life, then, we perceive what is called "conventional reality," which
                    simply means the familiar, everyday world of named things. This itself becomes the object of
                    awareness.</p>

                <p>During your daily activities, just be aware of what you are doing in the ordinary sense. For
                    instance, "now I'm washing dishes," "now I'm typing," "now I'm walking," "now I'm driving," "now I'm
                    talking," "now I'm cutting vegetables for dinner," and so on. You don't have to verbalize it. Just
                    swing your attention back to whatever is happening right here in the present. Focus on the general
                    activity at hand rather than getting lost in memories or fantasizing about the future. Throughout
                    the day keep bringing your mind back to the present, asking yourself, "What is happening right now?"
                    or "What am I doing now, this very moment?" At times, if you find it helpful, you can label your
                    activities with a mental note.</p>

                <p>Even in daily life, however, there will be times when you aren't performing an activity and don't
                    need to engage in conceptual thinking, such as when riding on the bus or waiting in line at a store.
                    You can take advantage of those moments by being mindful of the rising-falling movements of the
                    abdomen or observing your posture, even if only for a minute or two.</p>

                <p>To sum up, mindfulness in daily life is mostly a matter of general awareness, dotted with short
                    periods of focusing on bare sense-impressions as conditions allow.</p>

                <p>However, in daily life it is usually more important to focus on the mind rather than on bodily
                    movements, because the defilements that might cause wrong speech or behavior arise in the mind, not
                    the body. Wrong behavior isn't much of a concern during vipassana practice since we're just sitting
                    or walking quietly, not interacting with anyone. Formal meditation is the time for training the
                    mind, for strengthening mindfulness. But ordinary life is the testing-ground. Daily life is filled
                    with situations that might provoke us into unwholesome speech and behavior. This is when we get to
                    see if the mind reacts differently than it used to. Are we less up and down? Do we let go of things
                    more quickly? When unpleasant events happen, is there less suffering? Do we know ourselves better?
                    Do we keep our attention in the present moment more, and get lost in memories less? In daily life we
                    should especially try to be aware whenever the mind is disturbed by a strong emotion, including
                    attachment or aversion, labeling the impulse with a mental note. "Aversion" includes jealousy, fear,
                    and anger, which are all forms of wanting to get rid of something. By seeing the impulse soon enough
                    we can stop it from getting stronger and further upsetting the mind.</p>

                <p>There is another aspect to mindfulness in daily life, which is called "clear comprehension," a type
                    of skillful understanding. Applied to daily life it means being aware of the motivations for, and
                    the purpose and results of, our speech and actions. The Buddha taught that before speaking we should
                    ask ourselves whether the words are true or false, harmful or helpful. Before criticizing a
                    co-worker, for example, we should decide whether the remark would truly be useful or would just hurt
                    the person. If not helpful we should refrain from saying it, even if it's true. This mental
                    examination doesn't have to take long. It can be done in just a second or two before speaking.</p>

                <p>It is even more important to consider our actions before performing them, to avoid doing anything
                    harmful and breaking the moral precepts. Throughout the day we should try to cultivate only
                    wholesome speech and actions. The more we practice mindfulness, the more clearly we will see the
                    hidden motives&mdash;selfish or otherwise&mdash;behind our speech and actions. Often we'll
                    immediately know whether our motives are wholesome or unwholesome.</p>

                <p>As we gain more experience we can apply clear comprehension to thoughts as well, trying to
                    deliberately cultivate wholesome thoughts based on wisdom, loving-kindness and compassion, and
                    gently letting go of unwholesome thoughts by not dwelling on or repeating them. At the same time, we
                    should remember never to judge ourselves for having unwholesome thoughts. Everyone who is not yet
                    fully enlightened has bad thoughts at times. We cannot control them. But that doesn't mean we should
                    act on them. When an unwholesome thought arises we can just be aware it has appeared and then gently
                    let it go. By "catching" these thoughts as soon as they arise, they'll have less chance of getting
                    stronger and influencing our speech and behavior.</p>

                <p>Whenever strong negative emotions such as anger or fear arise in daily life a meditator can always
                    use the very effective technique of mental noting. As soon as you're aware of the anger, simply note
                    "anger, anger," a few times, and then try to let the emotion go. If the anger is still there,
                    continue to observe the feeling without getting involved or caught up in it. Try to separate your
                    awareness from the anger. Merely watch the emotion as if you were standing outside of it. If you
                    continue watching it impartially, without getting caught up or acting on it through wrong speech, it
                    will change and, sooner or later, disappear. You will see this for yourself. All emotions and mental
                    states are impermanent. A few minutes from now you'll probably be thinking of something else and the
                    emotion may have vanished completely. Reminding yourself of this when a strong emotion overtakes you
                    can be a great help.</p>

                <p>There are other methods for skillfully dealing with negative emotions in daily life. If we believe,
                    for example, that someone is unfairly angry with us, instead of retaliating we can try to reflect
                    along these lines: "a person who is angry harms his <em>own</em> mind. Anger feels very
                    uncomfortable. It burns. An angry person is totally agitated and never at peace. Whether or not it
                    hurts anyone else, anger <em>always</em> hurts the one who's angry. Why should I hurt myself by
                    getting angry in return?" By habitually reflecting like this, our anger will diminish more quickly.
                </p>

                <p>Reflecting wisely on the Buddha's teaching of kamma (karma) can also help diminish anger, jealousy,
                    and other negative emotions. The Buddhist suttas describe many ways for dealing with unwholesome
                    emotions in daily life, which are too numerous to explain here. In his booklet <em>The Elimination
                        of Anger</em>, Ven. K. Piyatissa Thera describes eight ways to counteract anger, all taken from
                    the Buddhist suttas. These are skillful techniques we can use immediately, at any time. In the
                    long-term, however, the only permanent method for overcoming anger, anxiety, depression, fear and
                    other negative emotions is to practice vipassana meditation.</p>
