<p><em>Narrator One</em>. A commentator, or compeer, of the present time, who introduces the
others, and who represents a dispassionate onlooker with some general
knowledge of the events.</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. A commentator who supplies historical and traditional
information contained only in the medieval Pali commentaries (mainly
those of the fifth century by the Elder Buddhaghosa). His functions are
to give the minimum of such material needed for historical clarity and,
occasionally, to summarize portions of the Canon itself.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. The voice of the Elder Aananda, the disciple and personal
attendant of the Buddha, who recited the Discourses (or Suttas) at the
First Council, held at Raajagaha three months after the Buddha's
attainment of final Nibbaana.</p>

<p><em>Second Voice</em>. The voice of the Elder Upaali, disciple of the Buddha,
who recited the Discipline (or Vinaya) at the First Council.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Publisher's Note</a></p>

<p >The present Wheel booklet contains
Chapter 12 of Bhikkhu &Ntilde;aa.namoli's classic compilation, The Life of the
Buddha according to the Pali Canon. The purpose of that book, now in
print for 27 years, had been to construct a biography of the Buddha by
piecing together all the relevant material scattered throughout the
Vinaya and the Sutta Pi.takas. Since the Buddha's life was in many
respects inseparable from his teaching, Ven. &Ntilde;aa.namoli had included,
in the middle of the book, an anthology of texts dealing with the
teaching, which he entitled "The Doctrine." In his introduction he
described his purpose thus:</p>

<p>In Chapter 12 the main elements of
doctrine have been brought together roughly following an order
suggested by the Discourses. No interpretation has been attempted, &hellip;
but rather the material has been put together in such a way as to help
the reader make his own. A stereotyped interpretation risks slipping
into one of the types of metaphysical wrong view, which the Buddha
himself has described in great detail. If Chapter 12 is found rather
forbidding, let the last words of Anaathapi.n.dika be pleaded in
justification for its inclusion.&hellip;</p>

<p>The "last words of
Anaathapi.n.dika," the Buddha's chief patron, were: "Let such
(profound) talks on the Dhamma be given to the laity. There are some
with little dust in their eyes who are wasting through not hearing such
talks on the Dhamma. Some of them will gain final knowledge of the
Dhamma."</p>

<p>Several readers had suggested to the publisher that
Chapter 12 of Life of the Buddha could well stand on its own as an
excellent little handbook of the Buddha's teachings, useful for study,
reflection, and meditation. With this aim it is being issued as a
separate Wheel booklet. The structure of the anthology is based on the
formula of the Four Noble Truths and the eight factors of the Noble
Eightfold Path, which the Buddha announced in his First Sermon at
Benares and returned to again and again throughout his ministry. Within
this framework Ven. &Ntilde;aa.namoli has incorporated a wide variety of texts
which throw new and illuminating spotlights on the subtle implications
of these familiar formulas.</p>

<p>We hope this booklet will fulfil the purpose for which it is being published.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">What is the Dhamma?</a></p>

<p><em>Narrator One</em>.
What is the "Dhamma" that was "well proclaimed" by the "Supreme
Physician"? Is it an attempt to make a complete description of the
world? Is it a metaphysical system?</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>.
The Blessed One was once living at Saavatthii in Jeta's
Grove. A deity
called Rohitassa came to him late in the night, paid homage to him and
asked: "Lord, the world's end where one neither is born nor
ages nor
dies nor passes away nor reappears: is it possible to know or see or
reach that by travelling there?"</p>

<p>"Friend,
that there is a world's end
where one neither is born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor
reappears, which is to be known or seen or reached by travelling
there&mdash;that I do not say. Yet I do not say that there is
ending of
suffering without reaching the world's end. Rather it is in
this
fathom-long carcase with its perceptions and its mind that I describe
the world, the origin of the world, the cessation of the world, and the
way leading to the cessation of the world.</p>

<p class="right">SN 2:36; AN 4:46</p>

<p>"It is utterly impossible<br />

To reach by walking the world's end;<br />

But none escape from suffering<br />

Unless the world's end has been reached.<br />

It is a Sage, a knower of the world,<br />

Who gets to the world's end, and it is he<br />

By whom the holy life has been lived out;<br />

In knowing the world's end he is at peace<br />

And hopes for neither this world nor the next."</p>

<p>The Blessed One was once living at Kosambii in a wood of si.msapaa
trees. He picked up a few leaves in his hand, and he asked the
bhikkhus: "How do you conceive this, bhikkhus, which is more, the few
leaves that I have picked up in my hand or those on the trees in the
wood?"</p>

<p>"The leaves that the Blessed One has picked up in his hand are few, Lord; those in the wood are far more."</p>

<p>"So too, bhikkhus, the things that I have known by direct knowledge are
more: the things that I have told you are only a few. Why have I not
told them? Because they bring no benefit, no advancement in the holy
life, and because they do not lead to dispassion, to fading, to
ceasing, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to
Nibbaana. That is why I have not told them. And what have I told you?
'This is suffering; this is the origin of suffering; this is the
cessation of suffering; this is the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.' That is what I have told you. Why have I told it?
Because it brings benefit, and advancement in the holy life, and
because it leads to dispassion, to fading, to ceasing, to stilling, to
direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbaana. So, bhikkhus, let your
task be this: 'This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering, this
the cessation of suffering, this is the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.'"</p>


<p class="right">SN 56:31</p>

<p><em>Narrator One</em>. It is
not, then, an attempt to make some complete description of the world,
either internal or external. Is it a metaphysical system&mdash;a
consistent logical construction&mdash;and if so, what premiss is it
based on?</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. Once when the Blessed One had gone into Raajagaha for alms the
naked ascetic Kassapa went up to him, and after greeting him, he said:
"We would ask Master Gotama something, if Master Gotama would consent
to give an answer." &mdash; "It is not the time for questions, Kassapa;
we are among houses." He asked a second and a third time and received
the same reply. Then he said: "It is not much we want to ask, Master
Gotama." &mdash; "Ask, then, Kassapa, whatever you like."</p>

<p>"How is it, Master
Gotama, is suffering of one's own making?" &mdash; "Do not put it
like that, Kassapa." &mdash; "Then is suffering of another's
making?" &mdash; "Do not put it like that, Kassapa." &mdash; "Then is
suffering both of one's own and another's making?" &mdash;
"Do not put it like that, Kassapa." &mdash; "Then is suffering neither
of one's own nor another's making but fortuitous?" &mdash;
"Do not put it like that, Kassapa." &mdash; "Then is there no
suffering?" &mdash; "It is not a fact that there is no suffering: there
is suffering, Kassapa." &mdash; "Then does Master Gotama neither know
nor see suffering?" &mdash; "It is not a fact that I neither know nor
see suffering: I both know and see suffering, Kassapa."</p>

<p class="right">SN 12:17</p>

<p>Once too the wanderer
Uttiya went to the Blessed One, and after greeting him, he sat down at
one side. Then he asked: "How is it, Master Gotama, the world is
eternal: is only that the truth and everything else wrong?" &mdash;
"That is not answered by me, Uttiya." &mdash; "Then the world is not
eternal: is only that the truth and everything else wrong?" &mdash;
"That too is not answered by me, Uttiya." &mdash; "The world is finite:
is only that the truth and everything else wrong?" &mdash; "That too is
not answered by me, Uttiya." &mdash; "Then the world is infinite: is
only that the truth and everything else wrong?" &mdash; "That too is
not answered by me, Uttiya." &mdash; "The soul is the same as the body:
is only that the truth and everything else wrong?" &mdash; "That too is
not answered by me, Uttiya." &mdash; "Then the soul is one and the body
another: is only that the truth and everything else wrong?" &mdash;
"That too is not answered by me, Uttiya." &mdash; "After death a
Perfect One is: is only that the truth and everything else wrong?"
&mdash; "That too is not answered by me, Uttiya." &mdash; "Then after
death a Perfect One is not: is only that the truth and everything else
wrong?" &mdash; "That too is not answered by me, Uttiya." &mdash; "Then
after death a Perfect One both is and is not: is only that the truth
and everything else wrong?" &mdash; "That too is not answered by me,
Uttiya." &mdash; "Then after death a Perfect One neither is nor is not:
is only that the truth and everything else wrong?" &mdash; "That too is
not answered by me, Uttiya."</p>

<p>"But why does Master Gotama decline to answer when I ask him these questions? What then is answered by Master Gotama?"</p>

<p>"I teach the Dhamma to disciples from direct knowledge, Uttiya, for the
purification of beings, for surmounting sorrow and lamentation, for
ending pain and grief, for attainment of the true goal, for realizing
Nibbaana."</p>

<p>"Master Gotama, does that Dhamma provide an outlet from suffering for all the world, or for half, or for a third?"</p>

<p>When this was said, the Blessed One remained silent.</p>

<p>Then the Venerable
Aananda thought: "The wanderer Uttiya must not conceive any such
pernicious view as 'When the monk Gotama is asked a question peculiar
to me and to no one else and he founders and does not answer, is it
because he is unable?' That would be long for his harm and
suffering." So he said to him: "Friend Uttiya, I shall give you a
simile; for some wise men here get to know through a simile the meaning
of what is said.</p>

<p>"Suppose a king had a
city with strong ditches, ramparts and bastions, and a single gate, and
he had a wise, clever, sagacious gate-keeper there who stopped those
whom he did not know and admitted only those whom he knew; and since he
had himself gone round the path encircling the city and had seen no
gaps in the ramparts or any hole even big enough for a cat to pass
through, he might conclude that living beings above a certain size must
go in and out through the gate&mdash;so too, friend Uttiya, a Perfect
One's concern is not that 'All the world shall find an outlet by
this, or a half, or a third,' but rather that 'Whoever has found
or finds or will find an outlet from the world of suffering, that is
always done by abandoning the five hindrances (of desire for
sensuality, ill will, lethargy-and-drowsiness, agitation-and-worry, and
uncertainty), defilements that weaken understanding, and by maintaining
in being the seven factors of enlightenment with minds well established
on the four foundations of mindfulness.'</p>

<p>"Your question which you put to the Blessed One was framed in the wrong way; that was why the Blessed One did not answer it."</p>

<p class="right">AN 10:95</p>

<p>On another occasion
the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. Then he asked: "How is it, Master Gotama, does self
exist?" When this was said, the Blessed One was silent. "How is it,
then, Master Gotama, does self not exist?" And for a second time the
Blessed One was silent. Then the wanderer Vacchagotta got up from his
seat and went away. Not long after he had gone the Venerable Aananda
asked the Blessed One: "Lord, how is it that when the Blessed One was
questioned he did not answer?"</p>

<p>"If, when I was asked
'Does self exist?' I had answered 'Self exists,' that would
have been the belief of those who hold the theory of eternalism. And
if, when I was asked 'Does self not exist?' I had answered 'Self
does not exist,' that would have been the belief of those who
hold the theory of annihilationism. Again, if, when asked 'Does self
exist?' I had answered 'Self exists,' would that have been
in conformity with my knowledge that all things are not-self? And if,
when asked 'Does self not exist?' I had answered 'Self does not
exist,' then confused as he already is, Aananda, the wanderer
Vacchagotta would have become still more confused, assuming: 'Surely
then I had a self before and now have none.'"</p>

<p class="right">SN 44:10</p>

<p>At one time the
Blessed One was living at Saavatthii, and at that time a number of
wandering monks and brahmans of various sects had gone into Saavatthii
for alms. They had differing views, opinions, and notions, and they
relied for support on their differing views. There were some monks and
brahmans who asserted and believed that "The world is eternal: only
this is true, everything else is wrong," and some who asserted and
believed each of the other nine views. They quarreled, brawled,
wrangled, and wounded each other with verbal darts: "The Dhamma is like
this; the Dhamma is not like this! The Dhamma is not like this; the
Dhamma is like this!"</p>

<p>Then a number of
bhikkhus, on their return from their alms round, told the Blessed One
about it. The Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, there was once a certain
king in Saavatthi. He told a man: 'Come, man, get together all the men
in Saavatthii who have been born blind.' &mdash; 'Yes,
sire,' he replied. And when he had done so, he told the king, who
said, 'Then show them an elephant.' He did so, saying, 'You men
blind from birth, an elephant is like this,' and he showed the
elephant's head to some and its ear to others and its tusk to
others and its trunk to others and its body to others and its foot to
others and its rump to others and its tail to others and the tuft at
the end of its tail to others. Then he went to the king and told him
what he had done.</p>

<p>"So the king went to
the men blind from birth, and he asked them: 'Has an elephant been
shown to you?' &mdash; 'Yes, sire.' &mdash; 'Then describe
what the elephant is like.' Now those who had been shown the head
said 'Sire, the elephant is like a jar,' and those shown the ear
said 'It is like a winnowing basket,' and those shown the tusk
said 'It is like a post,' and those shown the trunk said 'It is
like a plough's pole,' and those shown the body said 'It is
like a granary,' and those shown the foot said 'It is like the
base of a column,' and those shown the rump said 'It is like a
mortar,' and those shown the tail said 'It is like a
pestle,' and those shown the tuft at the end of the tail said 'It
is like a broom.' They fought among themselves with their fists,
crying: 'The elephant is like this; it is not like this! The elephant
is not like this; it is like this!' But the king was pleased.</p>

<p>"So too the wanderers of other sects are blind and eyeless. That is why
they quarrel, brawl, wrangle, and wound each other with verbal darts:
'The Dhamma is like this; the Dhamma is not like this! The Dhamma is
not like this; the Dhamma is like this!'"</p>

<p class="right">Ud 6:4</p>

<p><em>Narrator One</em>. So it
would appear to be a mistake to call the Buddha's teaching either
an attempt to describe the world completely or a metaphysical system
built up by logic. Is it, then, an ethical commandment, a revealed
religion of faith, or simply a stoical code of behaviour? Before an
attempt can be made to find answers to those questions, some sort of a
survey of the doctrines taught is needed. The material contained in the
Discourses seems, in fact, to be rather in the nature of material for a
map, for each to make his own map, but all oriented alike. These
oriented descriptions of facets of experience, in fact, enable a person
to estimate his position and judge for himself what he had better do.</p>

<p>The Discourses offer
not so much a description as a set of overlapping descriptions. Close
examination of existence finds always something of the qualities of the
mirage and of the paradox behind the appearance. The ends can never be
made quite to meet. The innumerable different facets presented in the
Suttas with countless repetitions of certain of these facets in varying
combinations and contexts remind one of a collection of air photographs
from which maps are to be made. The facets in the Discourses are all
oriented to cessation of suffering, the four points of their compass
being the Four Noble Truths. Let us try to make a specimen map out of
some of this material. In this case, since a start has to be made
somewhere, we can start for our baseline with birth, which, like death,
is to the ordinary man an everyday fact and at the same time an
insoluble mystery.</p>

<a name="dd"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">There is No First Beginning</a></p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. Is consciousness conceivable without a past? Can it be said to have a beginning?</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "Bhikkhus, the round is beginningless. Of the beings that
travel and trudge through this round, shut in as they are by ignorance
and fettered by craving, no first beginning is describable."</p>

<p class="right">SN 15:1</p>

<p>"That both I and you
have to travel and trudge through this long round is owing to our not
discovering, not penetrating, four truths. What four? They are: (I) the
noble truth of suffering, (II) the noble truth of the origin of
suffering, (III) the noble truth of the cessation of suffering, and
(IV) the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering."</p>

<p class="right">DN 16</p>

<a name="ee"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">The Four Noble Truths</a></p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. Now here is a description of the Four Noble Truths.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. I. "What
is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering, ageing is
suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow and
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering; association with
the loathed is suffering, dissociation from the loved is suffering, not
to get what one wants is suffering; in short, the five aggregates
affected by clinging are suffering."</p>

<p class="right">SN 56:11</p>

<p>II. "What is the
noble truth of the origin of suffering? It is craving, which renews
being, and is accompanied by relish and lust, relishing this and that:
in other words, craving for sensual desires, craving for being, craving
for non-being. But whereon does this craving arise and flourish?
Wherever there is that which seems lovable and gratifying, thereon it
arises and flourishes."</p>

<p class="right">DN 22</p>

<p>"It is with ignorance
as condition that formations come to be; with formations as condition,
consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; with
name-and-form as condition, the sixfold base for contact; with the
sixfold base as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling;
with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition,
clinging; with clinging as condition, being; with being as condition,
birth; with birth as condition, ageing and death come to be, and also
sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; that is how there is
an origin to this whole aggregate mass of suffering. This is called the
noble truth of the origin of suffering."</p>

<p class="right">AN 3:61</p>

<p>III. "What is the
noble truth of the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless
fading and cessation of that same craving, the rejecting,
relinquishing, leaving and renouncing of it. But whereon is this
craving abandoned and made to cease? Wherever there is that which seems
lovable and gratifying, thereon it is abandoned and made to cease."</p>

<p class="right">DN 22</p>

<p>"With the
remainderless fading and cessation of ignorance there is cessation of
formations; with cessation of formations, cessation of consciousness
&hellip; with cessation of birth, ageing and death cease, and also
sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; that is how there is
a cessation to this whole aggregate mass of suffering. This is called
the noble truth of the cessation of suffering."</p>

<p class="right">AN 3:61</p>

<p>IV. "What is the
noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering? It is
this Noble Eightfold Path, that is to say: right view, right intention,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration."</p>

<p class="right">DN 22</p>

<p>"Of these Four Noble
Truths, the noble truth of suffering must be penetrated to by full
knowledge of suffering; the noble truth of the origin of suffering must
be penetrated to by abandoning craving; the noble truth of the
cessation of suffering must be penetrated to by realizing cessation of
craving; the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering must be penetrated to by maintaining in being the Noble
Eightfold Path."</p>

<p class="right">SN 56:11 and 29 (adapted)</p>

<p>"These Four Noble Truths (Actualities) are real, not unreal, not other than they seem."</p>

<p class="right">SN 56:27</p>

<p><em>Narrator One</em>. The Four Noble Truths are each analysed and defined in detail.</p>

<a name="ff"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">I &nbsp;The Truth of Suffering</a></p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. It was
said that the truth of suffering was "in short, the five aggregates
affected by clinging." Here are definitions of them.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "What
are the five aggregates affected by clinging? They are the (material)
form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by
clinging, the perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations
aggregate affected by clinging, and the consciousness aggregate
affected by clinging."</p>

<p class="right">DN 22</p>

<p>"Why does one say
'form'? It is deformed (ruppati), that is why it is called
'form' (ruupa). Deformed by what? By cold and heat and hunger and
thirst, by contact with gadflies, gnats, wind, sunburn and creeping
things."</p>

<p class="right">SN 22:79</p>

<p>"What is form? The four great entities and any form derived upon them by clinging are called form."</p>

<p class="right">SN 22:56</p>

<p>"Whatever in oneself,
belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, and clung to (organic),
such as head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin; flesh, sinews,
bones, bone-marrow, kidneys; heart, liver, midriff, spleen, lights;
bowels, entrails, gorge, dung, or whatever else in oneself, belonging
to oneself, is solid, solidified, and clung to: that is called earth
element in oneself. Now earth element in oneself and external earth
element are only earth element.</p>

<p>"Whatever in oneself
&hellip; is water, watery, and clung to, such as bile, phlegm, pus,
blood, sweat, fat; tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints,
urine, or whatever else in oneself &hellip; is water, watery, and clung
to: that is called water element in oneself. Now water element in
oneself and external water element are only water element.</p>

<p>"Whatever in oneself
&hellip; is fire, fiery, and clung to, such as that whereby one is
warmed, ages, and is consumed, and whereby what is eaten, drunk, chewed
and tasted gets digested and assimilated, or whatever else in oneself
&hellip; is fire, fiery, and clung to: that is called fire element in
oneself. Now fire element in oneself and external fire element are only

perceives, that one cognizes. By bare mind-consciousness disjoined from
the five sense-faculties the (external) base consisting of infiniteness
of space can be known thus 'infinite space'; the (external) base
consisting of infiniteness of consciousness can be known thus 'infinite
consciousness'; and the (external) base consisting of nothingness

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "These five aggregates affected by clinging have desire
for their root.&hellip; The clinging is neither the same as the five
aggregates affected by clinging, nor is it something apart from them.
It is the desire and lust comprised in them that is the clinging there."</p>

<p>"That comes to be when there is this; that arises with the arising of this."</p>

<p class="right">MN 38</p>

<p>"(In the statement of
dependent arising:) What is ageing? In the various orders of beings, it
is any being's ageing, old age, brokenness of teeth, greyness of
hair and wrinkledness, decline of life and weakening of
sense-faculties. What is death? In the various orders of beings, it is
any being's passing, passing away, dissolution, disappearance,
dying, completion of time, dissolution of aggregates, laying down of
the carcase. What is birth? In the various orders of beings, it is any
being's birth, coming to birth, precipitation in a womb,
generation, manifestation of aggregates, acquisition of bases for
contact. What is being? Three kinds of being are: being in the mode of
sensual desire, being in the mode of form, being in the mode of the
formless. What is clinging? There are four varieties of clinging:
clinging as the habit of sensual desire, clinging as the habit of wrong
view, clinging as the habit of (misapprehension of) virtue and duty,
and clinging as the habit of self-theories. What is craving? There are
six bodies of craving: craving for visible forms, sounds, odours,
flavours, tangibles, and ideas. What is feeling? There are six bodies
of (the three sorts of) feeling: feeling born of eye-contact, of
ear-contact, of nose-contact, of tongue-contact, of body-contact, and
of mind-contact. What is contact? There are six bodies of contact:
eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact,
mind-contact. What is the sixfold base? It is the eye-base, ear-base,
nose-base, tongue-base, body-base, and mind-base. What is
name-and-form? What is called name comprises feeling, perception,
choice, contact, and attention; what is called form comprises the four
great entities and any forms derived upon them by clinging; so this
name and this form are what is called name-and-form. What is
consciousness? There are six bodies of consciousness:
eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness,
tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, and mind-consciousness. What
are formations? Three formations are: the bodily formation, verbal
formation, and mental formation. What is ignorance? It is nescience
about suffering, about the origin of suffering, about the cessation of
suffering, and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering."</p>

<p class="right">SN 12:2</p>

<p>"Dependent on eye and

<p class="right">MN 38</p>

<p>"Dependent on eye and
visible forms, eye-consciousness arises; the coincidence of the three
is contact; with contact as condition, there arises what is felt as
pleasant or as painful or as neither-painful-nor-pleasant. If, on
experiencing the contact of pleasant feeling, one does not relish it or
welcome it or accept it, and if no underlying tendency in one to lust
for it any longer underlies it&mdash;if, on experiencing the contact of
painful feeling, one does not sorrow or lament or beat one's
breast, weep and become distraught, and if no underlying tendency in
one to resistance to it any longer underlies it&mdash;if, on
experiencing the contact of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, one
understands, as it actually is, the arising, disappearance,
gratification, dangerous inadequacy, and escape, in the case of that
feeling, and if no underlying tendency in one to ignorance any longer
underlies it&mdash;then, indeed, that one shall make an end of
suffering by abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant
feeling, by eliminating the underlying tendency to resist painful
feeling, and by abolishing the underlying tendency to ignore
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling: that is possible."</p>

<p class="right">MN 148</p>

<p>"When lust, hate, and
delusion are abandoned, a man does not choose for his own affliction or
for others' affliction or for the affliction of both. In that way
there comes to be Nibbaana here and now, without delay, inviting
inspection, onward-leading, and experienceable by the wise."</p>

<p class="right">AN 3:55</p>

<p>"Actions done out of

taints exhausted, who has lived out the life, done what was to be done,
laid down the burden, reached the highest goal, destroyed the fetters
of being, and who is completely liberated through final knowledge. His
five sense faculties remain, owing to the presence of which he still
encounters the agreeable and disagreeable, still experiences the
pleasant and painful. It is the exhaustion of lust, of hate, and of

<a name="ii"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">IV &nbsp;The Truth of the Way</a></p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. The fourth noble truth is the Noble Eightfold Path. Each of its eight components needs a separate definition.</p>

<p>(1) Right View</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "Just as
the dawn heralds and foretells the rising of the sun, so right view
heralds and foretells the penetration to the Four Noble Truths
according as they really are."</p>

<p class="right">SN 56:37</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. Right
view has many facets. Let us take them one by one, beginning with
"ripening of action," which, in certain forms and with some
reservations, is also shared by other teachings.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "Right view comes first. How? One understands wrong view
as wrong view, and one understands right view as right view. What is
wrong view. The view that there is nothing given, offered or
sacrificed, no fruit or ripening of good and bad actions, no this
world, no other world, no mother, no father, no apparitional beings, no
good and virtuous monks and brahmans who have themselves realized by
direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world: this is
wrong view.</p>

<p>"What is right view?
There are two kinds of right view: there is that affected by taints,
which brings merit and ripens in the essentials of existence; and there
is the noble ones' right view without taints, which is
supramundane and a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"What is right view
affected by taints? The view that there is what is given, offered and
sacrificed, and that there is fruit and ripening of good and bad
actions, and there is this world and the other world and mother and
father and apparitional beings and good and virtuous monks and brahmans
who have themselves realized by direct knowledge and declare this world
and the other world: this is right view affected by taints which brings
merit and ripens in the essentials of existence.</p>

<p>"And what is the
noble ones' right view? Any understanding, understanding faculty,
understanding power, investigation-of-states enlightenment factor,
right view as path factor, in one whose mind is ennobled and taintless,
who possesses the path, and who maintains it in being: this is the
noble ones' right view without taints, which is supramundane and
a factor of the path."</p>

<p class="right">MN 117</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. Again,
it is right view of dependent arising&mdash;the basic structure of the
"teaching peculiar to Buddhas" and the first of the new discoveries
made by the Buddha. Nothing can arise alone, without the support of
other things on which its existence depends.</p>

<p><em>Second Voice</em>."The spotless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in
him: All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation."</p>

<p>"The Perfect One has told the cause<br />

Of causally arisen things;<br />

And what brings their cessation too:<br />

Such is the doctrine preached by the Great Monk."</p>

<p class="right">Vin Mahaavagga 1:23</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "That
comes to be when there is this; that arises with the arising of this.
That does not come to be when there is not this; that ceases with the
cessation of this."</p>

<p class="right">MN 38</p>

<p>"He who sees dependent arising sees the Dhamma; he who sees the Dhamma sees dependent arising."</p>

<p class="right">MN 28</p>

<p>"Whether Perfect Ones
appear or not, there remains this element, this structure of things
(phenomena), this certainty in things, namely: specific conditionality.
A Perfect One discovers it."</p>

<p class="right">SN 12:20</p>

<p>"If there were no
birth altogether in any way of anything anywhere &hellip; there being
no birth, with the cessation of birth, could ageing and death be
described?" &mdash; "No, Lord." &mdash; "Consequently this is a reason,
a source, an origin, a condition, for ageing and death." (And so on
with the other pairs in the formula of dependent arising.)</p>

<p class="right">DN 15</p>

<p>"Lord, 'right view,
right view' is said. What does 'right view' refer to?"
&mdash; "Usually, Kaccaayana, this world depends upon the dualism of
existence and non-existence. But when one sees the world's origin
as it actually is with right understanding, there is for him none of
(what is called) non-existence in the world; and when he sees the
world's cessation as it actually is with right understanding,
there is for him none of (what is called) existence in the world.</p>

<p>"Usually the world is shackled by bias, clinging, and insistence; but
one such as this (who has right view), instead of allowing bias,
instead of clinging, and instead of deciding about 'my self,'
with such bias, such clinging, and such mental decision in the guise of
underlying tendency to insist, he has no doubt or uncertainty that what
arises is only arising suffering, and what ceases is only ceasing
suffering, and in this his knowledge is independent of others. That is
what 'right view' refers to. '(An) all exists' is one
extreme; '(an) all does not exist' is the other extreme. Instead
of resorting to either extreme, a Perfect One expounds the Dhamma by
the middle way: 'It is with ignorance as condition that formations come
to be; with formations as condition, consciousness; with
consciousness&hellip;' (And so on with both arising and
cessation.)"</p>

<p class="right">SN 12:15</p>

<p>"If one asserts: 'He
who makes (suffering) feels (it): being one existent from the
beginning, his suffering is of his own making,' then one arrives
at eternalism. But if one asserts: 'One makes (suffering), another
feels (it): being one existent crushed out by feeling, his suffering is
of another's making,' then one arrives at annihilationism.
Instead of resorting to either of these extremes, a Perfect One
expounds the Dhamma by the middle way: &hellip; (that is, by dependent
arising and cessation)."</p>

<p class="right">SN 12:17</p>

<p>"All beings are maintained by nutriment."</p>

<p class="right">DN 33; AN 10:27, 28; Khp 2</p>

<p>"What is nutriment?
There are these four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings
that already are, and for the assistance of those seeking renewal of
being: they are physical food as nutriment, gross or subtle, contact as
the second, choice as the third, and consciousness as the fourth."</p>

<p class="right">SN 12:63; MN 38</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. The
very essence of right view is, however, understanding of the Four Noble
Truths, which embrace dependent arising and constitute the "teaching
peculiar to Buddhas." They formed the subject of the First Sermon.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "What is
right view? It is knowledge of suffering, of the origin of suffering,
of the cessation of suffering, and of the way leading to the cessation
of suffering: this is called right view."</p>

<p class="right">SN 45:8; DN 22</p>

<p>(I) "'Four venomous snakes' is a name for the four great entities (of earth, water, fire, and air)."</p>

<p class="right">SN 35:197SN 22:95</p>

<p>"Form is like a lump of froth,<br />

Feelings like a water bubble,<br />

Perception too is like a mirage,<br />

Formations like a plaintain trunk.<br />

And consciousness, the Sun's Kinsman shows,<br />

Seems nothing but a conjuring trick."</p>

<p>"The six bases in oneself can be termed an empty village; for whether a
wise man investigates them as to the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or
mind, they appear alike hollow, empty, and void. The six external bases
can be termed village-raiding robbers; for the eye is harassed among
agreeable and disagreeable forms, the ear among such sounds, the nose
among such odours, the tongue among such flavours, the body among such
tangibles, and the mind among such mental objects."</p>

<p class="right">SN 35:197Sn 4:2</p>

<p>(II) "In the world I see this generation<br />

Racked by craving for being,<br />

Wretched men gibbering in the face of Death,<br />

Still craving, hoping for some kind of being.<br />

See how they tremble<br />

Over what they claim as 'mine,'<br />

Like fishes in the puddles of a failing stream."</p>

<p>(III) "This is (the
most) peaceful, this is (the goal) superior (to all), that is to say,
the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all essentials of
existence, the exhaustion of craving, cessation, Nibbaana."</p>

<p class="right">AN 10:60MN 75</p>

<p>(IV) "The greatest of (worldly) gains is health;,<br />

Nibbaana is the greatest bliss;<br />

The eightfold path is the best of paths,<br />

To lead in safety to the Deathless."</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. Again it is right view of the three general
characteristics of impermanence, suffering (or insecurity), and
not-self, which express comprehensively what dependent arising
expresses structurally. They were the subject of the Second Sermon.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "There are three formed characteristics of what is formed:
arising is evident, fall is evident, and alteration of what is present
is evident. There are three unformed characteristics of what is
unformed: no arising is evident, no fall is evident, and no alteration
of what is present is evident."</p>

<p class="right">AN 3:47</p>

<p>"When one understands
how form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness (and how
the eye, etc.) are impermanent, one therein possesses right view."</p>

<p class="right">SN 22:51; 35:155</p>

<p>"All is impermanent.
And what is the all that is impermanent? The eye is impermanent, forms
are impermanent, eye-consciousness &hellip; eye-contact, whatever is
felt as pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant born of
eye-contact is impermanent. The ear, etc.&hellip; The nose,
etc.&hellip; The tongue, etc.&hellip; The body, etc. &hellip; The mind
is impermanent, mental objects &hellip; mind-consciousness &hellip;
mind-contact &hellip; whatever is felt &hellip; born of mind-contact is
impermanent."</p>

<p class="right">SN 35:43</p>

<p>"What is impermanent is suffering, what is suffering is not-self."</p>

<p class="right">SN 35:1; 22:46</p>

<p>"Whether Perfect Ones
appear or not, there remains this element, this structure of things

<p class="right">AN 3:134</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, I do not
dispute with the world: the world disputes with me. One who proclaims
the Dhamma disputes with no one in the world. What wise men in the
world say there is not, that I too say there is not; and what wise men
in the world say there is, that I too say there is. Wise men in the
world say there is no permanent, everlasting, eternal form which is not
subject to change, and I too say that there is none. (And so too of the
other four aggregates.) Wise men in the world say that there is
impermanent form, which is suffering and subject to change, and I too
say that there is. (And so with the other four aggregates.)"</p>

<p class="right">SN 22:94</p>

<p>"This body is impermanent, it is formed and dependently arisen."</p>

<p class="right">SN 36:7</p>

<p>"It would be better
for an untaught ordinary man to treat as self this body, which is
constructed upon the four great entities, than mentality. Why? Because
this body can last one year, two years &hellip; a hundred years; but
what is called 'mentality' and 'mind' and
'consciousness' arises and ceases differently through night and
day, just as a monkey ranging through a forest seizes a branch, and,
letting that go, seizes another."</p>

<p>"Fruitful as the act
of giving is &hellip; yet it is still more fruitful to go with
confident heart for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha
and undertake the five precepts of virtue.&hellip; Fruitful as that is
&hellip; yet it is still more fruitful to maintain loving-kindness in
being for only as long as the milking of a cow &hellip; fruitful as
that is &hellip; yet it is still more fruitful to maintain perception
of impermanence in being only for as long as the snapping of a finger."</p>

of suffering? When someone is overcome, and his mind is obsessed by
suffering, either he sorrows and laments, and beating his breast, he
weeps and becomes distraught, or else he undertakes a search
externally: 'Who is there that knows one word, two words, for the
cessation of suffering?' I say that suffering either ripens in
confusion or in search."</p>

<p class="right">AN 6:63</p>

<p>"That anyone should

<p>"All form, feeling,
perception, formations, and consciousness, of whatever kind, whether
past, future, or present, in oneself or external, coarse or fine,

self.'"</p>

<p>"That in the world by
which one perceives the world and conceives conceits about the world is
called 'the world' in the Noble One's Discipline. And what
is it in the world with which one does that? It is with the eye, ear,

<p>"When a bhikkhu
abides much with his mind fortified by perception of impermanence, his
mind retreats, retracts, and recoils from gain, honour, and renown

instead of reaching out to it.&hellip; When he abides much with his
mind fortified by perception of suffering in impermanence, there is
established in him vivid perception of fear, of laxity, indolence,
idleness, negligence, and failure in devotion and reviewing, as of a
murderer with poised weapon.&hellip; when he abides much with his mind
fortified by perception of not-self in suffering, his mind is rid of
the conceits that treat in terms of 'I' and 'mine' this
body with its consciousness and all external signs."</p>

<p class="right">AN 7:46</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. The
rationalized "self-theory," which is called, in whatever form it may
take, "both a view and a fetter," is based upon a subtle fundamental
distortion in the act of perceiving, the "conceit 'I am,'" which
is "a fetter, but not a view." Now self-theories may or may not be
actually formulated; but if they are, they cannot be described
specifically without reference to the five aggregates. For that reason
they can, when described, all be reduced to one of the types of what is
called the "embodiment view," which is set out schematically. These are
all given up by the stream-enterer, though the conceit "I am" is not.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "How
does there come to be the embodiment view?" &mdash; "Here the untaught
ordinary man who has no regard for noble ones and is unconversant with
their Dhamma and Discipline &hellip; sees form as self, or self as
possessed of form, or form as in self, or self as in form. (And so with
each of the other four aggregates: feeling, perception, formations, and
consciousness.) A well-taught noble disciple does not do this."</p>

<p class="right">MN 44; MN 109</p>

<p>"The untaught
ordinary man who has no regard for noble ones &hellip; gives unreasoned
(uncritical) attention in this way: 'Was I in the past? Was I not in
the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been
what, what was I in the past? Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be
in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the
future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?' Or else
he wonders about himself now in the presently arisen period in this
way: 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Whence has this being come?
Whither is it bound?'</p>

<p>"When he gives unreasoned attention in this way, then one of six types
of view arises in him as true and established: 'My self exists'
or 'My self does not exist' or 'I perceive self with self'
or 'I perceive not-self with self' or 'I perceive self with
not-self' or some such view as 'This is my self that speaks and
feels and experiences here or there the ripening of good and bad
actions; but this my self is permanent, everlasting, not subject to
change, and will endure as long as eternity.' This field of views
is called the thicket of views, the wilderness of views, the contortion
of views, the vacillation of views, the fetter of views. The untaught
ordinary man bound by the fetter of views is not freed from birth,
ageing and death, sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief, and despair: he
is not freed from suffering, I say."</p>

<p class="right">MN 2</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, there are
two kinds of (wrong) view, and when deities and human beings are in
their grip, some hang back and some overreach; it is only those with
vision that see.</p>

<p>"How do some hang
back? Deities and human beings love being, delight in being, enjoy
being; when the Dhamma is expounded to them for the ending of being,
their hearts do not go out to it or acquire confidence, steadiness, and</p>

<p>"And how do some
overreach? Some are ashamed, humiliated, and disgusted by that same
being, and they look forward to non-being in this way: 'Sirs, when with
the dissolution of the body this self is cut off, annihilated, and
accordingly after death no longer is, that is the most peaceful, that
is the goal superior to all, that is reality.' So some overreach.</p>

<p>"And how do those
with vision see? Here a bhikkhu sees whatever has come to being as come
to being. By seeing it thus he has entered upon the way to dispassion
for it, to the fading and ceasing of lust for it. That is how one with
vision sees."</p>

<p class="right">It 49</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, the
possession that one might possess that were permanent, everlasting
&hellip; do you see any such possession?" &mdash; "No, Lord." &mdash;
"&hellip;The self-theory clinging whereby one might cling that would
never arouse sorrow and &hellip; despair in him who clung thereby; do
you see any such self-theory clinging?" &mdash; "No, Lord." &mdash;
"&hellip; The view as support that one might take as support that would
never arouse sorrow and &hellip; despair in him who took it as support;
do you see any such view as support?" &mdash; "No, Lord." &mdash;
"&hellip;Bhikkhus, there being self, would there be self's
property?" &mdash; "Yes, Lord." &mdash; "And there being self's
property, would there be self?" &mdash; "Yes, Lord." &mdash; "Bhikkhus,
self and self's property being unapprehendable as true and
established, then would not this view &mdash; 'This is the world, this
the self; after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not
subject to change, I shall endure as long as eternity'&mdash;be
the pure perfection of a fool's idea?"&mdash;"How could it not
be, Lord? It would be the pure perfection of a fool's idea."</p>

<p class="right">MN 22</p>

<p>"Whenever any monks
or brahmans see self in its various forms, they all of them see the
five aggregates affected by clinging, or one or another of them. Here
an untaught ordinary man who disregards noble ones &hellip; sees form
as self, or self as possessed of form, or form as in self, or self as
in form (or he does likewise with the other four aggregates). So he has
this (rationalized) seeing, and he has also this (fundamental) attitude
'I am'; but as long as there is the attitude 'I am' there
is organization of the five faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and
body. Then there is mind, and there are ideas, and there is the element
of ignorance. When an untaught ordinary man is touched by feeling born
of the contact of ignorance, it occurs to him 'I am' and 'I am
this' and 'I shall be' and 'I shall not be' and 'I
shall be with form' and 'I shall be formless' and 'I shall
be percipient' and 'I shall be unpercipient' and 'I shall
be neither percipient nor unpercipient.' But in the case of the
well-taught noble disciple, while the five sense faculties remain as
they are, his ignorance about them is abandoned and true knowledge
arisen. With that it no more occurs to him 'I am' or &hellip; 'I
shall be neither percipient not unpercipient.'"</p>

<p class="right">SN 22:47</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. The
ordinary man is unaware of the subtle fundamental attitude, the
underlying tendency or conceit "I am." It makes him, in perceiving a
percept, automatically and simultaneously conceive in terms of "I,"
assuming an I-relationship to the percept, either as identical with it
or as contained within it, or as separate from it, or as owning it.
This attitude, this conceiving, is only given up with the attainment of
arahantship, not before. (See e.g. MN 1 and MN 49.)</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. " 'I am' is derivative, not underivative. Derivative
upon what? Derivative upon form, feeling, perception, formations, and
consciousness."</p>

<p class="right">SN 22:83</p>

<p>"When any monk or brahman, with form (and the rest) as the means, which
is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, sees thus 'I am
superior' or 'I am equal' or 'I am inferior,' what is
that if not blindness to what actually is?"</p>

<p class="right">SN 22:49</p>

<p>(Questioned by
elders, the Elder Khemaka said:) "I do not see in these five aggregates
affected by clinging any self or self's property &hellip; yet I
am not an arahant with taints exhausted. On the contrary, I still have
the attitude 'I am' with respect to these five aggregates
affected by clinging, although I do not see 'I am this' with
respect to them.&hellip; I do not say 'I am form' or 'I am
feeling' or 'I am perception' or 'I am formations' or
'I am consciousness,' nor do I say 'I am apart from form &hellip;
apart from consciousness'; yet I still have the attitude 'I
am' with respect to the five aggregates affected by clinging
although I do not see 'I am this' with respect to them.</p>

<p>"Although a noble disciple may have abandoned the five more immediate
fetters (see below), still his conceit 'I am,' desire 'I
am,' underlying tendency 'I am,' with respect to the five
aggregates affected by clinging remains as yet unabolished. Later he
abides contemplating rise and fall thus: 'Such is form, such is its
origin, such its disappearance' (and so with the other four),
till by so doing, his conceit 'I am' eventually comes to be
abolished."</p>

<p class="right">SN 22:89</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. Lastly, we come to the ten fetters, which are progressively broken by the four stages of realization.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "An
untaught ordinary man who disregards noble ones &hellip; lives with his
heart possessed and enslaved by the embodiment view, by uncertainty, by
misapprehension of virtue and duty, by lust for sensuality, and by ill
will, and he does not see how to escape from them when they arise;
these, when they are habitual and remain uneradicated in him, are
called the more immediate fetters."</p>

<p class="right">MN 64</p>

<p>"The five more remote
fetters are: lust for form, lust for the formless, conceit (the conceit
'I am'), distraction, and ignorance."</p>

<p class="right">DN 33</p>

<p>"There are bhikkhus
who, with the exhaustion of (the first) three fetters, have entered the
stream, are no more subject to perdition, certain of rightness, and
destined to enlightenment. There are bhikkhus who, with the exhaustion
of three fetters and the attenuation of lust, hate, and delusion, are
once-returners: returning once to this world, they will make an end of
suffering. There are bhikkhus who, with the destruction of the five
more immediate fetters, are destined to reappear spontaneously
elsewhere and will there attain final Nibbaana, never returning
meanwhile from that world. There are bhikkhus who are arahants with
taints exhausted, who have lived out the life, done what was to be
done, laid down the burden, reached the highest goal, destroyed the
fetters of being, and who are completely liberated through final
knowledge."</p>

<p class="right">MN 118</p>

<p>"That which is the exhaustion of lust, of hate, and of delusion is called arahantship."</p>

<p class="right">SN 38:2</p>

<p>"When a bhikkhu
travels in many countries, learned people of all stations will ask him
questions. Learned and inquiring people will ask 'What does the
venerable one's teacher tell, what does he preach?' Rightly
answering you can say: 'Our teacher preaches the removal of desire and
lust.' And if you are then asked 'Removal of desire and lust for
what?' you can answer: 'Removal of desire and lust for form (and
the rest).' And if you are then asked 'But what inadequacy
(danger) do you see in those things?' you can answer: 'When a
person is not without lust and desire and love and thirst and fever and
craving for these things, then with their change and alteration, sorrow
and lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise in him.' And if
you are then asked 'And what advantage do you see in doing thus?'
you can answer: 'When a person is free from lust and desire and love
and thirst and fever and craving for form, feeling, perception,
formations, and consciousness, then, with their change and alteration,
no sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise in him."</p>

<p class="right">SN 22:2</p>

<p>(2) Right Intention</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. The survey of right view is now concluded. The next factor of the Noble Eightfold Path is right intention.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "What is
right intention? It is the intention of renunciation, the intention of
non-ill will, the intention of non-cruelty: this is called right
intention."</p>

<p class="right">SN 45:8; DN 22</p>

<p>"When a noble
disciple has clearly seen with right understanding, as it actually is,
how little gratification sensual desires provide and how much pain and
despair they entail, and how great is their inadequacy, and he attains
to happiness and pleasure dissociated from sensual desires and
unwholesome states, or to something higher than that, then he is no
more interested in sensual desires."</p>

<p class="right">MN 14</p>

<p>"Even if bandits
brutally severed him limb from limb with a two-handled saw, he who
entertained hate in his heart on that account would not be one who
followed my teaching."</p>

<p class="right">MN 21</p>

<p>"He does not choose for his own affliction, or for others' affliction, or for the affliction of both."</p>

<p class="right">MN 13</p>

<p>(3) Right Speech</p>

<p>Narrator Two</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. These
two factors of right view and right intention together constitute (the
group of path factors) "understanding" (pa.t.taa). Now the third
factor, right speech.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "What is right speech? Abstention from lying, slander, abuse, and gossip; this is called right speech."</p>

<p class="right">SN 45:8; DN 22</p>

<p>"Here someone
abandons lying: when summoned to a court or to a meeting or to his
relatives' presence or to his guild or to the royal
family's presence and questioned as a witness thus 'So, good man,
tell what you know,' then, not knowing, he says 'I do not
know,' knowing, he says 'I know,' not seeing, he says 'I do
not see,' seeing, he says 'I see'; he does not in full
awareness speak falsehood for his own ends or for another's ends
or for some petty worldly end.</p>

<p>"He abandons slander:
as one who is neither a repeater elsewhere of what is heard here for
the purpose of causing division from these, nor a repeater to these of
what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing division from those,
who is thus a reuniter of the divided, a promoter of friendships,
enjoying concord, rejoicing in concord, delighting in concord, he
becomes a speaker of words that promote concord.</p>

<p>"He abandons abuse:
he becomes a speaker of such words as are innocent, pleasing to the ear
and lovable, as go to the heart, are civil, desired of many and dear to
many.</p>

<p>"He abandons gossip:
as one who tells that which is seasonable, factual, good, and the
Dhamma and Discipline, he speaks in season speech worth recording,
which is reasoned, definite, and connected with good."</p>

<p class="right">MN 41</p>

<p>(4) Right Action</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em></p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. And the fourth factor, right action.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "What is
right action? Abstention from killing living beings, stealing,
misconduct in sensual desires: this is called right action."</p>

<p class="right">SN 45:8; DN 22</p>

<p>"When a lay follower
possesses five things, he lives with confidence in his house, and he
will find himself in heaven as sure as if he had been carried off and
put there. What are the five? He abstains from killing living beings,
from taking what is not given, from misconduct in sensual desires, from
speaking falsehood, and from indulging in liquor, wine, and fermented
brews."</p>

<p class="right">AN 5:172&ndash;73</p>

<p>(5) Right Livelihood</p>

<p>Narrator Two</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. And the fifth factor, right livelihood.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "What is
right livelihood? Here a noble disciple abandons wrong livelihood and
gets his living by right livelihood."</p>

<p class="right">SN 45:8; DN 22</p>

<p>"Scheming (to
deceive), persuading, hinting, belittling, and pursuing gain with gain;
this is called wrong livelihood (for bhikkhus)."</p>

<p class="right">MN 117</p>

<p>"There are five
trades that a lay follower should not ply. What five? They are: trading
in weapons, living beings, meat, liquor, and poisons."</p>

<p class="right">AN 5:177</p>

<p>(6) Right Effort</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em></p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. These
last three factors, right speech, action, and livelihood, constitute
(the group of path factors) "virtue" (siila). They are known as the
preliminary stage of the path. Now comes the sixth factor, right effort.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "What is
right effort? Here a bhikkhu awakens desire for the non-arising of
unarisen evil unwholesome states, for which he makes efforts, arouses
energy, exerts his mind, and endeavours. He awakens desire for the
abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome states, for which he makes
efforts.&hellip; He awakens desire for the arising of unarisen
wholesome states, for which he makes efforts.&hellip; He awakens desire
for the continuance, non-corruption, strengthening, maintenance in
being, and perfecting, of arisen wholesome states, for which he makes
efforts, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and endeavours: this is
called right effort."</p>

<p class="right">SN 45:8; DN 22</p>

<p>(7) Right Mindfulness</p>

<p>Narrator Two</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. Now comes the seventh factor, right mindfulness.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "What is
right mindfulness? Here a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a
body, ardent, fully aware and mindful, having put away covertousness
and grief for the world. He abides contemplating feelings as feelings,
ardent.&hellip; He abides contemplating consciousness as consciousness,
ardent.&hellip; He abides contemplating mental objects as mental
objects, ardent, fully aware and mindful, having put away covetousness
and grief for the world. This is called right mindfulness."</p>

<p class="right">SN 45:8; DN 22</p>

<p>"How does a bhikkhu
abide contemplating the body as a body? Here a bhikkhu, gone to the
forest or to the root of a tree or to a room that is void, sits down;
having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established
mindfulness in front of him, just mindful he breathes in, mindful he
breathes out. As a skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long
turn, understands 'I make a long turn,' or when making a short
turn, understands 'I make a short turn,' so, breathing in long,
the bhikkhu understands 'I breathe in long,' or breathing out
long, he understands 'I breathe out long'; breathing in short, he
understands 'I breathe in short,' or breathing out short, he
understands 'I breathe out short.' He trains thus: 'I shall
breathe in experiencing the whole body (of breaths)'; he trains
thus: 'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body (of
breaths).' He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in tranquillizing the
bodily formation (function)'; he trains thus: 'I shall breathe
out tranquillizing the bodily formation (function).'</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating the body as a body in this way either in himself, or externally, or in himself and externally.</p>

<p>"Or else he
contemplates in the body either its factors of origination, or its
factors of fall, or its factors of origination and fall.</p>

<p>"Or else mindfulness
that 'There is a body' is established in him to the extent of
bare knowledge and remembrance of it while he abides independent, not
clinging to anything in the world.</p>

<p>"That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>

<p>"Again, when walking,
a bhikkhu understands 'I am walking'; or when standing, he
understands 'I am standing'; or when sitting, he understands 'I
am sitting'; or when lying down, he understands 'I am lying
down.' Or whatever position his body is in, he understands it to
be so disposed.</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating the body as a body &hellip; externally.</p>

<p>"Or else he contemplates &hellip; the factors or origination and fall.</p>

<p>"Or else mindfulness &hellip; not clinging to anything in the world.</p>

<p>"That also is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>

<p>"Again, a bhikkhu is
fully aware in moving to and fro, in looking ahead and away, in flexing
and extending the limbs, in wearing the outer cloak of patches, the
bowl and other robes, in eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting, in
evacuating the bowels and making water, and he is fully aware and
mindful in walking, standing, sitting, going to sleep, waking, talking,
and keeping silent.</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating.&hellip;</p>

<p>"That also is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>

<p>"Again, as though
there were a bag with two openings full of many sorts of grain, such as
hill rice, red rice, beans, peas, millet, and white rice, and a man
with good sight had opened it and were reviewing it: 'This is hill
rice, this is red rice, this is beans, this is peas, this is millet,
this is white rice'; so too a bhikkhu reviews this body up from
the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair as full of many
kinds of filth: 'There are in this body head-hairs, body-hairs, nails,
teeth, skin; flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys; heart, liver,
midriff, spleen, lights; bowels, entrails, gorge, dung; bile, phlegm,
pus, blood, sweat, fat; tears, grease, spittle, snot,
oil-of-the-joints, and urine.'</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating.&hellip;</p>

<p>"That also is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>

<p>"Again, as though a
skilled butcher or his apprentice had slaughtered a cow and were seated
at the four crossroads with it cut up into pieces; so too, in whatever
position a bhikkhu finds this body, he reviews it according to the
elements: 'There are in this body earth element, water element, fire
element, and air element.'</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating.&hellip;</p>

<p>"That also is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>

<p>"Again, a bhikkhu
judges this same body as though he were looking at a corpse thrown on a
charnel ground, one-day dead, two-days dead, three-days dead, bloated,
livid, and oozing with matter: 'This body too is of such a nature, will
be like that, is not exempt from that.'</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating.&hellip;</p>

<p>"That also is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>

<p>"Again, a bhikkhu
judges this same body as though he were looking at a corpse thrown on a
charnel ground, being devoured by crows, kites, vultures, dogs,
jackals, and the multitudinous varieties of worms: &hellip; as though
he were looking at a corpse thrown on a charnel ground, a skeleton with
flesh and blood, and held together by sinews: &hellip; a fleshless
skeleton smeared with blood and held together by sinews:&hellip; a
skeleton without flesh or blood, held together by sinews: &hellip;
bones without sinews, scattered in all directions, here a hand-bone,
there a foot-bone, there a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, there a
hip-bone, there a back-bone, there a skull: &hellip; bones bleached
white, the colour of shells: &hellip; bones heaped up, more than a year
old: &hellip; bones rotted and crumbled to dust: 'This body too is of
such a nature, will be like that, is not exempt from that.'</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating.&hellip;</p>

<p>"That also is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>

<p>"And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating feelings as feelings?</p>

<p>"Here, when feeling a pleasant feeling, a bhikkhu understands 'I feel a
pleasant feeling'; when feeling a painful feeling, he understands
'I feel a painful feeling'; when feeling a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands 'I feel a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.' When feeling a
materialistic pleasant feeling, he understands 'I feel a materialistic
pleasant feeling'; &hellip; (and so with the other two). When
feeling an unmaterialistic pleasant feeling, he understands 'I feel an
unmaterialistic pleasant feeling'; &hellip; (and so with the
other two).</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating feelings as feelings in this way either in himself, or externally, or in himself and externally.</p>

<p>"Or else he
contemplates in feelings either their factors of origination, or their
factors of fall, or their factors of origination and fall.</p>

<p>"Or else mindfulness
that 'There are feelings' is established in him to the extent of
bare knowledge and remembrance of it while he abides independent, not
clinging to anything in the world.</p>

<p>"That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating feelings as feelings.</p>

<p>"And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating consciousness as consciousness?</p>

<p>"Here a bhikkhu
understands consciousness affected by lust as affected by lust, and
that unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust. He understands
consciousness affected by hate as affected by hate, and that unaffected
by hate as unaffected by hate. He understands consciousness affected by
delusion as affected by delusion, and that unaffected by delusion as
unaffected by delusion. He understands contracted consciousness as
contracted, and distracted consciousness as distracted. He understands
exalted consciousness as exalted, and that unexalted as unexalted. He
understands surpassed consciousness as surpassed, and that unsurpassed
as unsurpassed. He understands concentrated consciousness as
concentrated, and that unconcentrated as unconcentrated. He understands
liberated consciousness as liberated, and that unliberated as
unliberated.</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating consciousness as consciousness in this way
either in himself, or externally, or in himself and externally.</p>

<p>"Or else he
contemplates in consciousness its factors of origination, or its
factors of fall, or its factors of origination and fall.</p>

<p>"Or else mindfulness
that 'There is consciousness' is established in him to the extent
of bare knowledge and remembrance of it while he abides independent,
not clinging to anything in the world.</p>

<p>"That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating consciousness as consciousness.</p>

<p>"And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mental objects as mental objects?</p>

<p>"Here, a bhikkhu
abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in terms of the
five hindrances. How is that done? Here, when there is desire for
sensuality in him, he understands 'There is desire for sensuality in
me'; or when there is no desire for sensuality in him, he
understands 'There is no desire for sensuality in me'; and also
he understands how there comes to be the arising of unarisen desire for
sensuality, and how there comes to be the abandoning of arisen desire
for sensuality, and how there comes to be the future non-arising of
abandoned desire for sensuality. When there is ill will in him &hellip;
When there is lethargy and drowsiness in him &hellip; When there is
agitation and worry in him &hellip; When there is uncertainty in him
&hellip; he understands how there comes to be the future non-arising of
abandoned uncertainty.</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in himself, or externally, or in himself and externally.</p>

<p>"Or else he
contemplates in mental objects either their factors of origination, or
their factors of fall, or their factors of origination and fall.</p>

<p>"Or else mindfulness
that 'There are mental objects' is established in him to the
extent of bare knowledge and remembrance of it while he abides
independent, not clinging to anything in the world.</p>

<p>"That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in terms of the five hindrances.</p>

<p>"Again, a bhikkhu
abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in terms of the
five aggregates affected by clinging. How is that done? Here a bhikkhu
understands: 'Such is form, such its origin, such its disappearance;
such is feeling, such its origin, such its disappearance; such is
perception, such its origin, such its disappearance; such are
formations, such their origin, such their disappearance; such is
consciousness, such its origin, such its disappearance.'</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating.&hellip;</p>

<p>"That is how a
bhikkhu abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in terms
of the five aggregates affected by clinging.</p>

<p>"Again, a bhikkhu
abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in terms of the
six bases in oneself and external. How is that done? Here a bhikkhu
understands the eye and visible forms and the fetter that arises owing
to both; he understands how there comes to be the arising of the
unarisen fetter, and how there comes to be the abandoning of the arisen
fetter, and how there comes to be the future non-arising of the
abandoned fetter. He understands the ear and sounds &hellip; the nose
and odours &hellip; the tongue and flavours &hellip; the body and
tangibles &hellip; the mind and mental objects and the fetter that
arises owing to both; &hellip; and he understands how there comes to be
the future non-arising of the abandoned fetter.</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating.&hellip;</p>

<p>"That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in terms of the six bases in oneself and external.</p>

<p>"Again, a bhikkhu
abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in terms of the
seven enlightenment factors. How is that done? Here, when there is the
mindfulness enlightenment factor in him, a bhikkhu understands 'There
is the mindfulness enlightenment factor in me'; when there is no
mindfulness enlightenment factor in him, he understands 'There is no
mindfulness enlightenment factor in me'; and he understands how
there comes to be the arising of the unarisen mindfulness enlightenment
factor and how there comes to be the development and perfection of the
arisen mindfulness enlightenment factor. When there is the
investigation-of-states enlightenment factor in him &hellip; the energy
enlightenment factor in him &hellip; the happiness enlightenment factor
in him &hellip; the tranquillity enlightenment factor in him &hellip;
the concentration enlightenment factor in him &hellip; the equanimity
enlightenment factor in him &hellip; and he understands how there comes
to be the arising of the unarisen equanimity enlightenment factor and
how there comes to be the development and perfection of the arisen
equanimity enlightenment factor.</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating.&hellip;</p>

<p>"That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in terms of the seven enlightenment factors.</p>

<p>"Again, a bhikkhu
abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in terms of the
Four Noble Truths. How is that done? Here a bhikkhu understands
according as it actually is: 'This is suffering' and 'This is the
origin of suffering' and 'This is the cessation of
suffering' and 'This is the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.'</p>

<p>"He abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in himself, or externally, or in himself and externally.</p>

<p>"Or else he
contemplates in mental objects either their factors of origination, or
their factors of fall, or their factors of origination and fall.</p>

independent, not clinging to anything in the world.</p>

<p>"That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating mental objects as mental objects in terms of the Four Noble Truths.</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, were
anyone to maintain in being these four foundations of mindfulness for
seven years &hellip; let alone for seven years &hellip; for seven days,
then one of two fruits could be expected of him: either final knowledge
here and now, or else non-return."</p>

<p class="right">DN 22; MN 10</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, I shall
expound to you the origin and disappearance of the four foundations of
mindfulness: the body has nutriment for its origin, and it disappears
with cessation of nutriment; feelings have contact for their origin,
and they disappear with cessation of contact; consciousness has
name-and-form for its origin, and it disappears with cessation of
name-and-form; mental objects have attention for their origin, and they
disappear with cessation of attention."</p>

<p class="right">SN 47:42</p>

<p>"All things have
desire for their root, attention provides their being, contact their
origin, feeling their meeting-place, concentration confrontation with
them, mindfulness control of them, understanding is the highest of
them, and deliverance is their core."</p>

<p class="right">AN 8:83</p>

<p>"Would one guard
oneself, then the foundations of mindfulness should be cultivated;
would one guard others, then the foundations of mindfulness should be
cultivated. Who guards himself guards others; who guards others guards
himself."</p>

<p class="right">SN 47:19</p>

<p>(8) Right Concentration</p>

<p>Narrator Two</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. Now we come to the eighth and last factor, right concentration.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "What is right concentration?</p>

<p>"Here, quite secluded
from sensual desires, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu
enters upon and abides in the first meditation, which is accompanied by
thinking and exploring, with happiness and pleasure born of seclusion."</p>

<p class="right">DN 2; DN 22; MN 39; SN 45:8</p>

<p>"Just as a skilled
bath man or his apprentice heaps bath-powder in a metal basin, and
sprinkling it gradually with water, kneads it up till the moisture wets
his ball of bath powder, soaks it, and extends over it within and
without though the ball itself does not become liquid; so too, the
bhikkhu makes happiness and pleasure born of seclusion drench, steep,
fill, and extend throughout this body, so that there is nothing of his
whole body to which it does not extend."</p>

<p class="right">DN 2; MN 39</p>

<p>"With the stilling of
thinking and exploring he enters upon and abides in the second
meditation, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without
thinking and exploring, with happiness and pleasure born of
concentration."</p>

<p class="right">DN 2; DN 22; MN 39; SN 45:8</p>

<p>"Just as if there
were a lake whose waters welled up from below, having no inflow from
the east, west, north, or south, nor yet replenished from time to time
with showers from the skies, then the cool fount of water welling up
from the lake would make the cool water drench, steep, fill, and extend
throughout the lake, and there would be nothing of the whole lake to
which the cool water did not extend; so too, the bhikkhu makes
happiness and pleasure born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and
extend throughout this body, so that there is nothing of his whole body
to which they do not extend."</p>

<p class="right">DN 2; MN 39</p>

<p>"With the fading away
as well of happiness he abides in equanimity, and, mindful and fully
aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides
in the third meditation, on account of which the noble ones announce:
'He has a pleasant abiding who is an onlooker with equanimity and is
mindful.'"</p>

<p class="right">DN 2; DN 22; MN 39; SN 45:8</p>

<p>"Just as, in a pond
of blue or white or red lotuses, some lotuses are born under the water,
grow under the water, do not stand up out of the water, flourish
immersed in the water, and the water drenches, steeps, fills, and
extends throughout them to their tips and to their roots, and there is
nothing of the whole of those lotuses to which it does not extend; so
too, the bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of happiness drench,
steep, fill, and extend throughout this body, so that there is nothing
of his whole body to which it does not extend."</p>

<p class="right">DN 2; MN 39</p>

<p>"With the abandoning
of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and
grief, he enters upon and abides in the fourth meditation, which has
neither pain nor pleasure, and the purity of whose mindfulness is due
to equanimity."</p>

<p class="right">DN 2; DN 22; MN 39; SN 45:8</p>

<p>"Just as if a man
were sitting clothed from head to foot in white cloth, and there were
nothing of his whole body to which the white cloth did not extend; so
too the bhikkhu sits with pure bright cognizance extending over his
body and there is nothing of his whole body to which it does not
extend."</p>

<p class="right">DN 2; MN 39;</p>

<p>"What is the noble
ones' right concentration with its causes and its equipment? It
is any unifiedness of mind that is equipped with the other seven
factors of the path. Right view comes first: one understands wrong
view, intention, speech, action, and livelihood, as wrong; one
understands right view, intention, speech, action, and livelihood, as
right, each of two kinds, that is, either associated with taints and
ripening in the essentials of existence, or supramundane and a factor
of the path. One makes efforts to abandon wrong view and the other
four, and to acquire right view and the other four: this is one's
right effort. Mindfully one abandons the wrong and enters upon the way
of the right: this is one's right mindfulness."</p>

<p class="right">MN 117 (condensed)</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. These
last three factors, right effort, mindfulness, and concentration,
together constitute "concentration." The eight, with right knowledge
and right deliverance, are called the "ten rightnesses," which
constitute the "certainty of rightness" attained with the path of
stream-entry. Before leaving the subject of concentration, though,
there are four more stages attainable called the four "formless
states." They are extra to "right concentration," merely refinements of
the fourth meditation.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "With
the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance
of perceptions of resistance, by not giving attention to perceptions of
difference, (aware of) 'infinite space,' a bhikkhu enters upon
and abides in the base consisting of infinity of space.</p>

<p>"Again, by completely surmounting the base consisting of infinity of
space, (aware of) 'infinite consciousness,' he enters upon and
abides in the base consisting of infinity of consciousness.</p>

<p>"Again, by completely surmounting the base consisting of infinity of
consciousness, (aware that) 'there is nothing at all,' he enters
upon and abides in the base consisting of nothingness.</p>

<p>"Again, by completely surmounting the base consisting of nothingness,
he enters upon and abides in the base consisting of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>

<p>"The four meditations
are not called effacement in the Noble One's Discipline; they are
called in the Noble One's Discipline, a pleasant abiding here and
now. The four formless states are not called effacement in the Noble
One's Discipline; they are called in the Noble One's
Discipline, quiet abidings."</p>

<p class="right">MN 8</p>

<p>"This bhikkhu (who
practises these eight attainments) is said to have blindfolded Maara,
to have (temporarily) deprived Maara's eyesight of its object and
become invisible to the Evil One."</p>

<p class="right">MN 25</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. None of
these eight attainments is claimed as peculiar to the Buddhas'
teaching. The practice of them without right view leads only to heaven,
but not to Nibbaana. The teaching peculiar to Buddhas is the Four Noble
Truths. A ninth attainment, the "attainment of cessation," is described
as reached only in the two highest stages of realization and is thus
peculiar to Buddhas and their disciples.</p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. "By completely surmounting the base consisting of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides
in the cessation of perception and feeling, and his taints are
exhausted by his seeing with understanding. Then a bhikkhu is said to
have blindfolded Maara, to have deprived Maara's eyesight of its
object and become invisible to the Evil One, and, what is more, to have
gone beyond all attachment to the world."</p>

<p>MN 25SN 1:23</p>

<p>"When a wise man, established well in virtue,<br />

Develops consciousness and understanding,<br />

Then as a bhikkhu, ardent and sagacious,<br />

He succeeds in disentangling this tangle."</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, if one man were to travel and trudge through one age, then
the heap, the pile, the mass of his bones would be as high as this
Vepulla Hill, if they were collected and the store were not destroyed."</p>

<p class="right">It 24</p>

<p>"Suppose a man threw
into the ocean a yoke with one hole in it, and then the east wind blew
it west and the west wind blew it east and the north wind blew it south
and the south wind blew it north; and suppose there were a blind turtle
that came up to the surface once at the end of each century. How do you
conceive this, bhikkhus, would that blind turtle eventually put his
head through that yoke with the one hole in it?"</p>

<p>"He might, Lord, at the end of a long period."</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, the blind
turtle would sooner put his head through that yoke with a single hole
in it than a fool, once gone to perdition, would find his way back to
the human state."</p>

<p class="right">MN 129</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, the Dhamma
well proclaimed by me thus is frank, open, evident, and stripped of
padding. In this Dhamma well proclaimed by me thus, any who have simply
faith in me, simply love for me, are destined for heaven."</p>

<p class="right">MN 22</p>

<p>"What should be done
for the disciples out of compassion by a teacher who seeks their
welfare and is compassionate, that I have done for you. There are these
roots of trees, these rooms that are void: meditate, bhikkhus, do not
delay lest you regret it later. This is our instruction to you."</p>

<p class="right">MN 8; MN 152</p>

<p><em>Narrator Two</em>. That concludes the survey. But how is the Way actually followed?</p>

<a name="jj"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">The Noble Eightfold Path in Practice</a></p>

<p><em>First Voice</em>. One
morning the Venerable Aananda dressed, and taking his bowl and outer
robe, he went into Saavatthii for alms. He saw Jaa.nusso.ni the brahman
driving out of Saavatthii in a chariot drawn by four mares, all in
white: white steeds, white harnesses, white chariot, white upholstery,
white sandals; and he was even being fanned with a white fan. When
people saw this, they said: "What a divine vehicle! Now that is like a
divine vehicle!"</p>

<p>On his return, the
Venerable Aananda told the Blessed One about it, and he asked: "Lord,
can a divine vehicle be pointed to in this Dhamma and Discipline?"</p>

<p>"It can, Aananda,"
the Blessed One said. "'Divine vehicle' is a name for the Noble
Eightfold Path; and so is 'vehicle of Dhamma,' and so is
'peerless victory in battle'; for all the components of the Noble
Eightfold Path culminate in the expulsion of lust, hate, and delusion."</p>

<p class="right">SN 45:4</p>

<p>"(Once a child is
conceived and with birth and the growth of youth) his sense faculties
mature, then he becomes furnished and invested with the five strands of
sensual desires and exploits them: forms cognizable through the eye
that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and likable, connected with
sensual desire and provocative of lust; likewise sounds cognizable
through the ear, odours cognizable through the nose, flavours
cognizable through the tongue, and tangibles cognizable through the
body.</p>

<p>"On seeing a visible
form with the eye, hearing a sound with the ear, smelling an odour with
the nose, tasting a flavour with the tongue, touching a tangible with
the body, cognizing an idea with the mind, he lusts after it if it is
likable, or has ill will towards it if it is dislikable. He abides
without mindfulness of the body established and with mind limited while
he does not understand as they actually are the deliverance of mind and
deliverance by understanding wherein those evil unwholesome states
cease without remainder. Engaged as he is in favouring and opposing,
when he feels any feeling, whether pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he relishes that feeling, affirms and
accepts it. Relishing arises in him when he does that. Now any
relishing of those feelings is clinging. With his clinging as
condition, being; with being as condition, birth; with birth as
condition, ageing and death come to be, and also sorrow and
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. That is how there is an origin
to this whole aggregate mass of suffering.</p>

<p>"Here a Perfect One
appears in the world, accomplished and fully enlightened, perfect in
true knowledge and conduct, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of
men to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened, blessed. He
declares this world with its deities, its Maaras and its Brahmaas, this
generation with its monks and brahmans, with its princes and men, which
he has himself realized by direct knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma good
in the beginning, the middle, and the end, with the meaning and the
letter, and he announces a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure.</p>

<p>"Some householder, or
his son, or one born in some clan, hears that Dhamma. On hearing it, he
has faith in the Perfect One. Possessed of that faith, he considers:
'Household life is crowded and dirty, life gone forth is wide open. It
is not easy, living in a household, to lead a holy life as utterly
perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shaved off hair and
beard, put on the yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into
homelessness?'</p>

<p>"And on another
occasion, abandoning perhaps a small, perhaps a large fortune,
abandoning perhaps a small, perhaps a large circle of relatives, he
shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the yellow robe, and goes forth
from the home life into homelessness.</p>

<p>"Being thus gone
forth and possessing the bhikkhus' training and way of life, he
abandons killing living beings, abstaining therefrom with rod and
weapon laid aside; gentle and kindly, he abides compassionate to all
beings. He abandons taking what is not given, abstaining therefrom by
taking only what is given; expecting only what is given, he abides pure
in himself by not stealing. He abandons in celibacy; he lives the
celibate life as one who lives apart, abstaining from vulgar lechery.
He abandons false speech, abstaining therefrom by speaking truth;
cleaving to truth when he speaks, he is trustworthy, reliable and
undeceiving of the world. He abandons slander.&hellip; He abandons
abuse.&hellip; He abandons gossip &hellip; he speaks in season speech
worth recording, which is reasoned, definite, and connected with good.</p>

<p>"He abstains from
injuring seeds and plants. He eats only in one part of the day,
refraining from food at night and late meals. He abstains from dancing,
singing, music, and theatrical shows; from wearing garlands, smartening
with scents, and embellishing with unguents; from high and large
couches; from accepting gold and silver, corn, raw meat, women and
girls, bondswomen and bondsmen, sheep and goats, poultry and pigs,
elephants, cattle, horses and mares, fields and lands; from going on
errands; from buying and selling; from false weights, false metals, and
false measures; from cheating, deceiving, defrauding, and trickery;
from mutilating, executing, imprisoning, robbery, plunder, and violence.</p>

<p>"He is content with
robes to protect the body, with almsfood to sustain the belly, so that
wherever he goes he takes everything with him, just as whenever a
winged bird flies it flies using its own wings. Possessing this store
of the noble ones' virtue, he feels in himself a bliss that is
blameless.</p>

<p>"He becomes one who, on seeing a form with the eye, apprehends no signs
and features through which, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil
unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him; he
practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, gives
effect to restraint of the eye faculty. (Likewise, on hearing a sound
with the ear, smelling an odour with the nose, tasting a flavour with
the tongue, touching a tangible with the body, and cognizing an idea
with the mind.) Possessing this noble ones' faculty restraint, he
feels in himself an unsullied bliss.</p>

<p>"He comes to be fully aware when moving to and fro &hellip; and keeping silent.</p>

<p>"Possessing this
store of the noble ones' virtue, and this noble ones'
faculty restraint, and this noble ones' mindfulness and full
awareness, he resorts to a secluded resting place&mdash;to the forest,
a tree root, a rock, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a
jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw. On returning from his
alms round after the meal, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise,
setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness in front of him.</p>

<p>"Abandoning
covetousness for the world, he abides with a mind devoid of
covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. Abandoning ill
will and hatred, he abides with no thought of ill will, compassionate
for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill
will and hatred. Abandoning lethargy and drowsiness, he abides with a
mind free of lethargy and drowsiness, percipient of light, mindful and
fully aware; he purifies his mind from lethargy and drowsiness.
Abandoning agitation and worry, he abides unagitated with mind stilled
in himself; he purifies his mind of agitation and worry. Abandoning
uncertainty, he abides with a mind that has outgrown uncertainty,
questioning no more about unwholesome states; he purifies his mind of
uncertainty."</p>

<p class="right">MN 38</p>

<p>"Suppose a man
borrowed a loan and undertook works and the works succeeded so that he
repaid all the money of the old loan and there remained over some extra
for his wife and children; then on considering that, he was glad and
joyful; or suppose a man was afflicted, suffering and gravely ill and
his food did not sustain him and his body had no strength, but later he
recovered from the affliction and his body regained strength; or
suppose a man were imprisoned in a prison-house, but later he was
released from imprisonment safe and sound with no loss to his property;
or suppose a man were a bondsman, not self-dependent but dependent on
others and unable to go where he wanted, but later he was freed from
that bondage and was self-dependent, independent of others and a
freeman able to go where he wanted; or suppose a man with property and
goods entered on a road across a desert, but later he crossed over the
desert safe and sound with no loss to his property; then on considering
that, he was glad and joyful; so too, when these five hindrances are
unabandoned in himself, a bhikkhu sees them respectively as a debt, a
disease, a prison-house, a bondage, and a road across a desert; and
when they are abandoned in himself, he sees that as unindebtedness,
health, release from prison, freedom from bondage, and a land of
safety."</p>

<p class="right">MN 39</p>

<p>"Having abandoned the
five hindrances, mental imperfections that weaken understanding, then
quite secluded from sensual desires, secluded from unwholesome states,
he enters upon and abides in the first meditation &hellip; the second
meditation &hellip; the third meditation &hellip; the fourth meditation.</p>

<p>"On seeing a form with the eye, hearing a sound with the ear, smelling
an odour with the nose, tasting a flavour with the tongue, touching a
tangible with the body, cognizing an idea with the mind, he does not
lust after it if it is likable; and he has no ill will towards it if it
is dislikable. He abides with mindfulness of the body established and a
measureless state of mind while he understands as they actually are the
deliverance of mind and deliverance by understanding wherein those evil
unwholesome states cease without remainder. Having thus abandoned
favouring and opposing, when he feels any feeling, whether pleasant or
painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he does not relish that
feeling or affirm or accept it.</p>

<p>"When he does not do
that, his relishing of those feelings ceases. With cessation of his
relishing, cessation of clinging; with cessation of clinging, cessation
of being; with cessation of being, cessation of birth; with cessation
of birth, ageing and death cease, and also sorrow and lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair; that is how there is a cessation to this
whole aggregate mass of suffering."</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">The Means</a></p>

<p>"Suppose
a man wanting a snake saw a large snake, and when he wrongly grasped it
by its coils or its tail, it turned back and bit him, on which account
he came to death or deadly suffering&mdash;why? because of his wrong
grasp of the snake&mdash;; so too, some misguided men learn the Dhamma
without examining the meaning of the teachings with understanding, so
they acquire no liking for meditating upon them. Learning it instead
for the sake of carping and rebuttal of criticism, they fail to
appreciate the purpose for which the Dhamma is learnt, and they find
that the teachings being wrongly grasped by them, for long conduce to
their harm and suffering.</p>

<p>"But suppose a man who wanted a snake saw a large one, and when he
caught it in a forked stick and rightly grasped it by the neck, then
for all it might wrap its coils about his hand or arm or limbs, still
he would not on that account come to death or deadly suffering; so too
some clansmen learn the Dhamma and examine the meaning of the teachings
with understanding, so that they acquire a liking for meditating upon
them. Not learning it for the sake of carping and rebuttal of
criticism, they appreciate the purpose for which the Dhamma is learnt,
and they find that those teachings being rightly grasped by them, for
long conduce to their welfare and happiness.</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, suppose a traveller saw a great expanse of water, whose near
shore was dangerous and fearful and whose further shore was safe and
free from fear, but there was no ferry or bridge. Then after
considering this, he collected grass and branches and twigs and leaves
and bound them together into a raft, supported by which, and making
efforts with his hands and feet, he got safely across. Then, when he
had got across, he thought: 'This raft has been very helpful to me
since by its means I got safely across; suppose I hoist it on my head
or load it on my shoulder and go where I mean to go?' Now would
he be doing what should be done with a raft?" &mdash; "No, Lord."
&mdash; "What should he do with it? If, when he got across, he thought:
'This raft has been very helpful to me since by its means I got safely
across; suppose I haul it up on dry land or set it adrift on the water
and go where I mean to go?', then that is how he is doing what
should be done with the raft. So I have shown you how the Dhamma
resembles a raft in being for the purpose of crossing over, not for
