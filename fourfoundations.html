<h2>The Four Foundations of Mindfulness</h2>

<p class="by">A Dhamma Talk by Ven. Sopako Bodhi Bhikkhu</p>

<p><em>[Note: the comments in brackets are the editor's.]</em></p>
<p>
The dhamma talk tonight is on the four foundations of
mindfulness. 'Vipassana' means to develop
mindfulness until it becomes insight-knowledge [the
realization of impermanence, unsatis- factoriness, and
impersonality]. In order to get insight-knowledge you have
to observe the four foundations of mindfulness. The
foundations are four kinds of objects to put mindfulness
on. It's like a table - all four legs have to be
stable before you can put something on the table.
</p>
<p>
Another example is the foundation of a building. Before
constructing this meditation center, for instance, someone
had to lay the foundation. They had to use materials like
steel and concrete. Whether or not it's a good
foundation depends on whether the builder was smart enough
to do the job right.
</p>
<p>
It's the same thing with mindfulness. You have to lay
the foundation first. The Discourse on the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness [Satipatthana Sutta] says that
we should use four kinds of material - four objects to lay
the foundation for mindfulness. These four objects are: 1)
body; 2) feeling; 3) consciousness; and 4) mental objects
[the last group includes the five sense-impressions -
colors, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches - which are
material in nature]. Only when these four phenomena are
known in the present, from moment-to-moment, can they be
used as objects of mindfulness. When you develop
mindfulness based on these foundations, wisdom will arise.
</p>
<p>
So these four kinds of objects are used to build wisdom -
wisdom, as opposed to the pleasure or happiness that
arises from strong concentration [wisdom leads to the
supramundane happiness of nibbana. This happiness is more
correctly expressed as the complete absence of suffering].
If you don't have the correct foundation, wisdom
can't appear. It can't grow.
</p>
<p>
All of us have the materials to lay the foundation
already. I have a body and you have a body. We also have
feeling. When you sit too long you have pain. When I sit
too long I have pain, too. That's feeling. Feeling
doesn't belong to anyone [in the ultimate sense, you
do not own your feelings because they are not amenable to
your control]. Feeling belongs to conditions, to the
universe. Everyone has the same materials. Everyone has a
body made of the same four elements: earth, air, fire, and
water. Everyone experiences the same feelings: unpleasant,
pleasant and neutral. It doesn't make any difference
who you are.
</p>
<p>
We all have the same types of consciousness, too. For
example, everyone has desire, hatred and delusion in the
mind - everyone except arahants [those who have reached
the highest level of enlightenment]. They have eliminated
all mental defilements. Their minds are already pure,
clean, and perfect. But those who aren't enlightened -
laypersons - all have the same impurities in the mind.
</p>
<p>
All of us experience the same emotions: sadness, anxiety,
anger, excitement, confusion and doubt. Since everyone has
the same materials, we know that these things belong to
the universe, not to a nationality. They don't belong
to Thais or Canadians or Americans. The body belongs to
the truth. Feeling belongs to the universe. Consciousness
belongs to conditions. Mental objects and emotions belong
to cause and effect.
</p>
<p>
We have to accept the feelings and emotions that arise.
That's the way it is. When you feel sad, anxious,
frustrated or happy, don't attach to that emotion.
Don't think, "I am sad, I am anxious, I am
frustrated, I am happy." [In truth, an emotion is an
impersonal phenomenon. And even the consciousness that
knows the emotion is impersonal. It isn't a self.]
</p>
<p>
You don't have to attach to the things you experience.
Just observe them or know them so they become objects of
mindfulness. Just watch to see how long they stay.
</p>
<p>
Usually they don't last long - they just arise and
disappear right away. Sometimes an emotion appears and
stays for awhile. After that it passes away. Everything is
impermanent. Emotions aren't permanent at all.
Everything is unsatisfactory (dukkha) - meaning, it never
stays long. It's unstable. Everything in the universe
is nonself. It doesn't belong to anyone.
</p>
<p>
We can't truly control mind and matter. That's the
truth, all right? We need to see the truth in each of the
four kinds of objects of mindfulness. When we observe them
in the present moment, then all four objects, body,
feeling, consciousness, and mental contents, will be seen
as they really are - as impermanent, unsatisfactory, and
not belonging to self.
</p>
<p>
But how do we know what the correct path is? The Buddha
taught that since you have a body and mind, those are the
path. The tools to practice with are your own body and
mind. You have to separate the two. The body and other
material phenomena are called 'rupa.' Mind is
called 'nama.'
</p>
<p>
The mind is made up of consciousness and mental factors.
Feeling is a mental factor. Feeling is nama. Everyone has
rupa and nama, the same material and mental phenomena. The
Buddha said that even after he died, all of us would still
have rupa and nama, still have a body, feeling,
consciousness and mental factors. That means that we can
practice insight meditation anywhere, anytime. Since the
way is still here, enlightenment can occur at any time.
</p>
<p>
To observe everything so that your experience becomes one
of continuous, moment-to-moment mindfulness - that's
the correct path. That's what the Buddha meant by the
right way. Not all meditation techniques go in the
direction of nibbana. Only this way, the Buddha said. Only
by practicing mindfulness can we destroy greed, hatred and
delusion and reach enlightenment. It doesn't matter if
the Buddha is still in the world or not. People can find
the truth from observing their own bodies and minds.
</p>
<p>
For the first foundation of mindfulness we observe
body-objects. The body-objects that we use are 1) motion
and 2) posture. Posture means: sitting standing, walking,
and lying down. These are the main objects. The principal
object is 'rising and falling' [the expanding and
contracting motions of the abdomen that result from
respiration].
</p>
<p>
The second foundation is feeling. We observe unpleasant,
pleasant, or neutral feeling, whether it arises from body
or mind. [Although the body can be a condition for feeling
to arise, feeling itself is always a mental phenomenon.]
</p>
<p>
The third foundation is consciousness. Thinking is a
consciousness object. Even when the mind wanders, that
wandering mind can become an object for mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
The fourth foundation includes emotions such as the five
hindrances: anger, lust, doubt, sleepiness, and
restlessness. And the five sense-impressions: sights,
sounds, smells, tastes and touches. All of them can become
objects of mindfulness if you try to 'come back to the
present moment' to know what is going on now. Using
the technique of insight meditation, you will see for
yourself that mind and matter arise and pass away every
moment - that they are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and
impersonal. When you see that, how can you cling to them?
How can you build more desire, hatred and delusion?
</p>
<p>
All you need to do is come back to the present moment.
That means to bring your attention back to rupa and nama
as they arise - only that. To come back to the present
moment means to observe sitting, standing walking or lying
down - or any of the other objects.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes you'll just observe rupa, the body.
That's all right. You don't need to worry about
nama (mental) objects at first. Not until mindfulness is
stable. Then mindfulness will be strong enough to observe
more subtle objects. First you take care of mindfulness,
then mindfulness will take care of you.
</p>
<p>
When it's strong, mindfulness will stop greed, hatred
and delusion from taking over. It'll stop mental
formations from building something good or bad based on
the objects that appear to you. It's very important to
build mindfulness first, to take care of it first.
Afterwards it will take care of everything that happens in
your life and in your mind.
</p>
<p>
Just do it. Meaning, just turn the hand [referring to a
meditation exercise using hand movements. See "How to
Meditate"]. At same time, observe how you feel. By
'feeling' I don't mean sensation. Just know
the feeling of the hand moving, that's all - the
feeling of knowing the motion. Just do it lightly. You
don't have to concentrate too much or try very hard or
pay attention too much. Just keep doing it.
</p>
<p>
Practicing vipassana means to give the mind a job to work
on. That's all you need to do. The job of the mind
means that when you aren't observing the hand moving,
you observe the rising-and-falling movements of the
abdomen [or another object]. That's the job of the
mind, too. The mind is still working with or observing the
process of life from one moment to the next. But right now
we move the hand. That means the mind is working with the
hand motions. Just allow the mind to work. The mind means
consciousness. Just turn the hand and raise it up lightly,
smoothly. You don't have to use too much intention.
</p>
<p>
In observing the first foundation, the body, you have to
understand the two definitions of 'body.'
That's what the Pali text says. One is the body that
results from karma [volitional action] we did in the past.
</p>
<p>
The physical body as a whole is a result from karma.
Whether our bodies have all the correct parts or not
depends on the karma we did before [in previous
lifetimes]. If someone is born without all ten fingers,
for example, or is missing some other part of the body,
that's a result of karma. If someone's body is
complete, it's a good result from actions they did in
previous lifetimes. [However, simply being born as a human
being, in whatever circumstances, is considered the result
of good karma.]
</p>
<p>
We can't make use of the physical body itself for
insight meditation because it doesn't come from causes
in the present moment [i.e., it's already formed. We
can't make it or see it come into being now]. But
since we already have a body, we have to have a mind in
it, right?
</p>
<p>
The mind makes certain physical phenomena appear in the
present moment. These are the second type of body. What
are these physical phenomena? One of them is motion. The
motion that appears in the present moment when you move an
arm or a leg is different from the arm or leg itself. The
first one comes from the mind. The second comes from
karma.
</p>
<p>
Once we're born, we can't make the body look like
this or that according to our desire, right? There's
nothing much we can do to change it. But in the present
time, consciousness makes motion arise. Motion is
'rupa.' [Here, rupa means a physical phenomenon
that can be directly experienced as an object of the
mind.]
</p>
<p>
The Pali text says that we should observe 'the body in
the body.' But what is in the body? What is in the
hand? We can describe bones and muscles and tendons. Or we
can say there are four elements in the hand: water, earth,
fire and air, nothing else. But that isn't the meaning
of 'in the body.' According to the Satipatthana
Sutta, 'in the body' means the motion or activity
of the physical body. It comes from the mind. The mind
makes it happen.
</p>
<p>
The physical body that comes from our parents is the body
from karma. But that body has to sit, stand, walk, work
and eat. The actions of the body are 'body in the
body.' By observing the actions of the body, you
develop the first foundation of mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
Another rupa [material phenomenon] that comes from the
mind is posture. The mind makes the body sit, stand, walk,
and move in the present. The sitting posture is 'in
the body' - it comes from the mind. When the mind
wants to sit, it makes the body sit. When the mind wants
to stand up, it makes the body stand. The mind wants to
walk - it makes the feet move step-by-step. The mind wants
to lie down - it makes the body lie down. Those are the
four postures that come from the mind. The mind makes them
happen in the present. That means these postures and
motions can be objects of mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
That's very profound and subtle - not easy to
understand. It's difficult because the Pali text [in
the Satipatthana Sutta] has many descriptions about the
physical body and its thirty-two parts. It gives
instructions about concentrating on dead bodies in
cemeteries in the tradition of the forest monks. But
actually those are concentration exercises.
</p>
<p>
Many meditation teachers make the mistake that observing
the thirty-two parts of the body or contemplating a dead
body is insight meditation [see the revered text, the Path
of Purification (Visuddhimagga) which states that the
latter are concentration, not vipassana, exercises]. If we
don't understand how to separate the physical body
from its movement, it's very hard to use the body as a
foundation for mindfulness. We just make a mistake.
That's why the Pali text explains that we should
observe 'the body in the body.'
</p>
<p>
Unless you understand how to put mindfulness on the
correct foundation, it can't stay. So you have to
separate the physical body, which is the result of karma,
from the body's movement, which comes from the mind.
You can see movement happening right now. It comes from
consciousness. The body from karma can't become the
object of mindfulness. But the motion of that physical
body can be an object for mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
We should observe only motion or posture when observing
the body in meditation. We can use the motion of the leg,
the hand or the abdomen [i.e., the abdominal movements
from respiration] as a foundation. But we can't use
the hand, leg or abdomen themselves as foundations for
mindfulness. That's impossible. Why? Because the hand
is just material or matter. It has nothing to do with the
mind. We can use the physical body to develop
concentration, but we can't put mindfulness on the
hand itself, or the leg, or any part of the body.
</p>
<p>
So you need to be smart to separate the body's motion
and posture from its corporeality, in order to get the
correct foundation to put mindfulness on. That's why
[in the hand motions exercise] I tell you to observe the
movement of the hand. Don't pay attention to the hand
itself. Just observe the motion. Only motion can become
the foundation, not the physical hand. If you're still
observing the hand, that's not the correct foundation.
</p>
<p>
It's the same when observing the rising-falling
motions of the abdomen. Don't focus on the stomach or
the physical body part. Just notice the feeling of motion.
By 'feeling' I don't mean the feeling of
pleasure or pain that's the second foundation of
mindfulness. Just know the movement when the abdomen rises
and falls. That's the foundation to put mindfulness
on. The technique is to keep mindfulness continuous
whether you're sitting, standing, walking, or lying
down. Don't give a gap for delusion.
</p>
<p>
If you don't have the correct foundation, mindfulness
can't stay, can't grow. Mindfulness is like a
flower seed. All of you have the seeds of mindfulness. But
you have to understand how to plant the seeds in good
soil. You have to water them, just like one of the monks
in this temple waters the flowers every day. All of us
have seeds of mindfulness but we don't understand how
to take care of them or how to plant them where
they'll grow. Sometimes we put mindfulness on the
sand. How can it grow? Sometimes we put it on the
concrete. It dries up. Sometimes we put the seeds of
mindfulness in a lake. They rot and never grow. Many
people think they have mindfulness, but they put it in the
wrong place.
</p>
<p>
When the sun shines against a tree it casts a shadow. You
can see the shadow. The shadow has the same shape as the
tree, but it isn't identical to the tree. You can
touch the tree. It's always there in front of the
temple. It stays permanently. But the shadow is only there
sometimes.
</p>
<p>
The shadow depends on the sun. It depends on the tree too,
but if there's no sun there can be no shadow. The
shadow is impermanent but the tree [for all practical
purposes] is permanent. Some trees live for thirty or
forty or even a hundred years. But the shadow is
impermanent [in the sense of being momentary]. In the
morning the sun appears in the east and the shadow shows
on this side. In the evening, when the sun goes west, the
shadow changes to the east. It moves little by little all
the time. But the tree stays in the same place. So the
shadow is impermanent but the tree is permanent.
</p>
<p>
Now, the physical body that comes from karma is like the
tree. The mind is like the sun. The activity of the body
is like the shadow. Just as the shadow is caused by the
sun, the motion of the body comes from the mind. We
practice insight meditation to see the truth of
impermanence. We observe the activity of the body because
it's impermanent, like the shadow.
</p>
<p>
So when we talk about the first foundation of mindfulness,
we mean movement and posture. The objects to observe are:
1) the rising and falling motions of the abdomen [that
occur from respiration]; 2) the motion of the feet during
walking meditation; 3) the motion of the hand during the
hand movements exercise; 4) the sitting posture; 5) the
standing posture 6) the lying down posture, and 7)
touch-points.
</p>
<p>
The last body-object we haven't talked about yet.
It's called a touching-point. That means you bring the
mind to rest on a point on the body for one moment at a
time, just being aware of knowing the contact - the
contact of the mind 'touching' that point. [This
is mental touching, not physical.] There is still movement
present because the mind moves. Mindfulness can watch as
the mind moves to that point, lets the point go, then
returns to it again. And you can see the moment of contact
arise and vanish.
</p>
<p>
You can also observe other movements such as the act of
reaching for a cup, the movement of the arm when washing
your face, and so on. Any physical action can become the
foundation for mindfulness if you observe it as it's
happening, in the present moment.
</p>
<p>
Second Foundation<br>
Feeling is the second foundation of mindfulness. Feeling
objects are more subtle than body-objects. There is
feeling that comes from the physical body. When people sit
too long they get pain or numbness. They can't stay in
the same posture for long but have to move around.
That's the suffering that comes from sitting or
standing. Like the physical body, feeling is the result of
previous karma.
</p>
<p>
You should observe those mental factors that accompany
feeling or result from feeling. When you sit more than
thirty minutes, you feel uncomfortable. That's the
nature of the physical body. It happens to everyone. You
can't prevent it. But what happens then? When people
feel pain, they usually aren't aware of it because
they move too quickly. If they aren't practicing
meditation they change position right away. They follow
their desire without knowing what's happening. So one
of the mental factors that arises from feeling is desire.
That means that 'in' unpleasant feeling, or
accompanying unpleasant feeling, is desire.
</p>
<p>
Think about it. You want something - you want to change
posture. Wanting is desire. When you change to another
sitting position without awareness, you forget about the
pain because you think, "Wow - now it's good. I
can keep sitting." But after ten or twenty minutes,
the pain begins again. You don't ask yourself,
"Is the pain that comes from this posture the same as
the pain I felt in the old posture? Or is it
different?" You don't care. You just want to
change back again, want to move back again.
</p>
<p>
So you move back to the original position. What causes you
to do that? Desire. But the old position caused pain, too,
remember? It's the posture you moved out of in the
first place. So you see that 'in' [dependent on]
feeling is desire. And desire is a cause of suffering.
Desire causes you to return to a position that will later
become painful.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you can't sit anymore, so you stand up. You
stand up because you were feeling pain. It's desire
that wants to stand up, that wants to avoid the pain.
Desire makes people change posture. That means that
'in' feeling is the cause of suffering, because
the Buddha said that desire is the cause of suffering.
</p>
<p>
Desire doesn't just mean wanting to do something.
Disliking is desire, too [because you want to avoid
something]. There are three kinds of desire: liking,
disliking, and wanting to change to something new -
wanting to get a new posture or sight or smell or
something else. Liking comes from desire. Disliking comes
from hatred. Wanting to get something different comes from
delusion.
</p>
<p>
Say that I'm sitting. I have pain so I want to change
position, because I want to feel good. That's how
liking or wanting causes physical motion to occur. The new
posture arises because of wanting - because I want to move
into a new posture.
</p>
<p>
When I dislike sitting in the old posture, I want to take
the pain away. I have to move or change position because I
want to take the unpleasant feeling away. That's how
disliking becomes desire. I want to do something else.
When you get mad at something you want to get rid of it,
want to make it go away. That becomes a cause of
suffering. When you change position without mindfulness,
you continue to generate suffering, because desire is the
cause of suffering. All three levels of desire become a
cause of suffering.
</p>
<p>
You can stop the process by observing 'feeling in the
feeling.' That means to observe the desire that arises
from feeling, instead of acting on the desire right away.
When you feel pain, you have to observe the feeling before
changing posture. But it's important to know how to
deal with pain. Don't try to control it or suppress it
with concentration. Just accept it. Just understand that
it comes from sitting too long. After that you can change
position slowly, observing your movements step-by-step as
you change into a new position.
</p>
<p>
But don't change position with wrong view. Wrong view
means thinking, "I want to change posture because the
new position will feel good." You want to get
happiness. Usually, everyone wants to change because they
make a mistake. They think, "If I change, I'll
get happiness." But sooner or later even the new
posture becomes painful.
</p>
<p>
I have a saying: "Don't want to change; have to
change." If you understand that you have to change
position because the uncomfortable feeling is too strong,
you won't make the mistake of liking the new posture.
You'll know that the new posture is only comfortable
for a short time. You'll understand that suffering
forces the change in posture.
</p>
<p>
Even the Lord Buddha had pain when he stayed in one
position too long. All of the arahants [Enlightened Ones]
have unpleasant feeling from sitting too long, too. But
they aren't upset by it. They understand that it's
the result from sitting and can't be avoided.
</p>
<p>
But for us, disliking or aversion always arises in
response to pain. That's different from the Lord
Buddha and the arahants. They understood what is
'in' the pain. They understood that they had to
change position because the suffering was too strong, but
they didn't feel disliking or hatred for the pain.
They didn't have the desire to get a good feeling.
Pain appears because the physical elements are unbalanced.
Enlightened beings understand that they have to change the
position of the body because the elements are unbalanced.
</p>
<p>
So you should observe every kind of feeling, whether
pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, without liking or
disliking. That's the Middle Way.
</p>
<p>
Third Foundation<br>
The third foundation of mindfulness is consciousness.
Thinking is a consciousness object. When your mind wanders
away from the main object to think about something, just
be aware that you're thinking. When you're aware,
note, 'thinking' or 'wandering mind,' then
return to the main object or the principal object.
Don't think more. Don't describe what you're
thinking about or get interested in it.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't matter if you're thinking about
something good or bad. Forget about good and bad.
Don't pay attention to the content of the thought.
Just observe thinking to see that it arises and passes
away. To observe consciousness means to observe 'the
one who knows.' The 'one who knows' is the
mind, the observer. Just go back to observe the mind
itself, the knowing itself.
</p>
<p>
Even when the mind wanders, that wandering mind can become
an object of mindfulness if you're aware of it, and if
you observe the one who knows. The 'one who knows'
is mindfulness or awareness or clear comprehension. If you
aren't aware that the mind has wandered but you're
still observing the mind [if you are observing the story
that the mind is spinning], that's ignorance and
desire.
</p>
<p>
Usually the mind wants to think, wants to fool around.
That's desire. You know that you're thinking, but
you aren't knowing the correct moment [you aren't
observing the phenomenon of thinking arising and passing
away, but instead are becoming involved in the content of
the thought]. That means knowing by ignorance. Ignorance
doesn't mean someone who knows nothing. Ignorance
means that you don't know the truth or can't see
that the mind arises and passes away from moment to
moment. [Consciousness (and its mental factors) arises and
vanishes from moment to moment every time it focuses on an
object. With each new object, consciousness arises again,
and then dissolves.]
</p>
<p>
At first your mind will wander out often. That's all
right. Even if the mind wanders many times per minute,
just keep knowing 'wandering mind' and return to
the main object. When mindfulness gets stronger the mind
will wander less and less often. Just keep coming back to
the present moment over and over, a thousand times, a
million times. That's the practice of insight
meditation.
</p>
<p>
Fourth Foundation<br>
The fourth foundation of mindfulness is a large group
containing many kinds of objects.
</p>
<p>
All emotions are included in this foundation. As you
meditate, pleasant and unpleasant emotions will arise. How
should you observe anger, happiness, anxiety and other
emotions? By looking at them as if they were actors. But
don't become an actor. Don't get involved with
them. Don't get onstage. Just watch the play.
Sometimes the actors show excitement or happiness.
Sometimes they show anger, frustration, fear or sadness.
</p>
<p>
Say to yourself, "They're not me," and only
watch them to see how long they last. If you don't get
involved with them, if you don't cling to them, if you
don't think that they belong to you, you won't
suffer at all. Only know them, see them, watch them, like
watching actors on T.V. When they finish their duty to
show this or that thing they leave. Then another actor
comes, another feeling or another object. But they
aren't real. In the ultimate sense, what they show
isn't true - it's just an appearance. And these
actors - these feelings and emotions - change all the
time.
</p>
<p>
You believe that everything belongs to you: the body,
feeling, memory, mental formations, emotions and
consciousness. You think: I am seeing, I am liking, I am
disliking, I am hearing, I am smelling, tasting, feeling.
We believe that everything belongs to us because we form
attachment to all these things. But by the truth, these
five khandhas [the five phenomena we regard as self:
corporeality, feeling, consciousness, perception, and
mental formations] do not belong to anyone. Even your body
doesn't really belong to you. Your mind doesn't
belong to you, either, because you can't determine
what kinds of thoughts will arise. Things just appear in
the mind according to conditions.
</p>
<p>
There are a few more objects belonging to the fourth
foundation of mindfulness that are very important for
practicing insight meditation. These are: sight, sound,
touch, smell, and taste. You have to observe or focus on
objects from every one of the five senses as they arise.
An advanced meditator can practice anywhere, any time by
observing sight, sound, touch, smell and taste.
</p>
<p>
In the Buddha's time there was a man named Bahiya. One
day he followed the Lord Buddha on his alms round, asking
for meditation instruction. The Buddha gave him a very
short answer: "When you see, just see; when you hear,
just hear; when you think, just think; and when you know,
just know." Bahiya got enlightened right away, faster
than any of the other disciples.
</p>
<p>
So just do it. Just observe and let go. Focus and forget
it. When you're thinking, don't get involved with
the content of the thought. Don't attach to anything
that's going on around you. Just let it go. It's
very important to know how you can just see, just hear,
just smell, just touch, just think, just sit, just walk,
just stand, just lie down and just move, whether those
objects are pleasant or unpleasant. Don't care whether
an object is good or bad. That's not your duty. Only
focus and forget it.
</p>
<p>
'Focus' means to put mindfulness on the object
correctly, to pay attention to it. After that, forget it.
Why? Because an object of the mind never stays. It
isn't permanent. It will change and disappear. Why do
you have to keep clinging to it or thinking about it? Why
do you have to resist something unpleasant?
</p>
<p>
Don't cling to something good or resist something bad,
because good and bad are the same one. They're like
your hand. When you turn it over, you can see the palm.
When you turn it again, you can see the back. But it's
the same hand. Good and bad are like that. When bad comes
to an end, it turns to become good. When good is finished,
it changes to bad. Actually, they are the same one. So why
attach to them?
</p>
<p>
You become attached to something good, but then it changes
because everything is impermanent. When it changes to bad
you're still clinging, clinging to the bad thing too,
even though you don't like it. Then you resist a bad
object, but it's impermanent, too. And when it changes
to good, you're still resisting [because you
haven't noticed that the bad thing has already passed
away] - so you resist the good, too. What can you say?
When you don't understand that everything changes very
fast, you just feel excited with something good or try to
avoid something bad. But by the truth, there's no
difference. Good is just arising and passing away. Bad is
just arising and passing away, too.
</p>
<p>
For example, when you hear pleasant words, the sound only
lasts a short time and then it's gone. The good sound
can't stay very long. It arises and passes away right
away. It's the same when hearing a bad sound. If you
just hear the sound [instead of clinging to the meaning of
the words] a good sound isn't different from a bad
one. It's different only because people attach to the
conventional meaning and say, "This is a good word,
that's a bad word." But in truth we only have two
objects, rupa and nama. Those are the only objects of
mindfulness. They aren't good or bad.
</p>
<p>
So, just see, just hear, just smell, just touch, just
think, just sit, just walk, just stand, just lie down, and
just move. When you hear, only observe hearing the sound.
Don't think about whether it's a good sound or a
bad sound. Don't cling to it as belonging to you and
think, "I am hearing." Only observe hearing and
let it go. Whether you smell a good scent or a bad one
doesn't matter. When you smell something, just observe
that moment of smelling. Don't think, "I am
smelling something."
</p>
<p>
When eating, don't like or dislike the taste of the
food. It doesn't matter whether it's junk food or
health food, delicious or awful. When you taste it, just
observe the act of knowing the taste. That's the
middle way between liking and disliking. When you touch
something, just observe the feeling of contact. When
thinking, just know that there's thinking. Don't
get involved with the content of the thought. If it's
a pleasant thought, don't cling to it. If it's a
negative thought, don't get upset. Just know,
"Thinking is happening now." That's the
Middle Way.
</p>
<p>
All five sense-impressions are rupa (material phenomena).
Nama (mind) is aware of them. Color is rupa; nama sees
color. Sound is rupa; nama hears sound. Fragrance is rupa;
nama smells fragrance. Taste is rupa; nama knows taste. A
touch is rupa; nama knows touch. When you practice insight
meditation you must be aware of color, sound, taste, smell
and touch as they arise in the present. Don't describe
them or think about them more. Just know them as they
appear.
</p>
<p>
Just seeing, just hearing, just touching, just tasting,
and just smelling: that means that when you practice
mindfulness you stop at the point of seeing or hearing
before you get to the name of the thing. [You're aware
of the sight, etc., before the mind has time to recognize
or name it. In daily life, perception and recognition seem
to be simultaneous. But with mindfulness you can be aware
of the pure sense-datum before evaluating it.] That way
you separate ultimate reality from conventional truth.
</p>
<p>
Conventional truth means the name of the object. [Picks up
a bell] This is a bell, right? [Picks up a tape recorder]
This is the tape recorder. People make up the names of
these things. That's conventional truth. The bell is
not the tape recorder. The tape recorder isn't the
bell. That's true, right? But that's conventional
truth.
</p>
<p>
When practicing vipassana, the bell is just rupa because
you just see the color when you look at it. The tape
cassette is just rupa, too. You just see color, which is
rupa. According to ultimate truth, there's no
difference between the bell and the tape recorder because
in both cases you only see color.
</p>
<p>
It's the same when hearing sound. [Rings bell]
Everybody hears the same sound. English people say they
hear a bell. But that's not true. Thai people say they
hear a rakang. But that's not true, either. How can
you hear a bell or a rakang? You don't hear a bell -
you only hear sound. The bell can't physically go to
your ear. [Points to the bell on the floor] It's still
here, right?
</p>
<p>
The sound is rupa. Ear consciousness hears it. But English
people say, "I'm hearing a bell," and Thai
people say, "I'm hearing a rakang." They are
hearing the same thing, the same sound waves. But the
language is different. That's conventional truth - the
name of the thing, or the words to describe it as good or
bad. People make it up.
</p>
<p>
Conventional truth means the name of the thing. But
ultimate truth means just rupa [material phenomena] and
nama [mental phenomena]. Try to remember that the objects
of awareness in vipassana are only rupa and nama. All four
foundations of mindfulness can be reduced to these two:
rupa and rupa.
</p>
<p>
If you don't understand rupa and nama, how can you
practice vipassana? If you don't remember what rupa
and nama are - well, that's all right if you have a
teacher who can give instruction and tell you how to keep
observing from moment-to-moment with mindfulness. But if
you don't understand what rupa and nama are, and the
teacher can't tell you exactly how to observe from
moment-to-moment, there's no way to follow the
technique of vipassana at all. Then you're just
practicing another kind of meditation or using
concentration to suppress emotions or feel peaceful for a
short time.
</p>
<p>
So when you practice vipassana, you have to understand
what rupa is and what nama is. Just remember rupa and
nama. I'll conclude by saying: sitting is rupa,
standing is rupa, walking is rupa, lying down is rupa,
moving the hand is rupa. The agent that knows these
phenomena is nama, the mind. Also, color is rupa, sound is
rupa, smell is rupa, taste is rupa, and [tactile] contact
is rupa.
</p>
<p>
The agent that sees a picture, smells, hears, tastes, or
touches, is nama. The meditator has to observe or focus on
every sense. You can practice this way in daily life, by
observing the sense-objects. A long time ago the Buddha
taught people to practice vipassana and they were able to
practice at home, at work, or anywhere because they
understood that.
</p>
<p>
Practicing insight meditation is easy because we use the
materials from daily life. You don't have to do
anything special or different. All you have to do is
observe what is happening NOW. Just know: seeing,
smelling, touching, tasting, hearing, thinking, and
feeling. Just be aware of anger, excitement, fear and
other emotions when they appear. Just know and let go. If
you keep observing the four foundations of mindfulness
without liking or disliking, you will gain wisdom and
reach the happiness of nibbana.
