<p>Kamma
concerns everyone. We make it, a great deal of
it, every day while we are awake. We decide whether or not to get up
&mdash;
kamma. (Good kamma if one gets up vigorously, bad kamma if slothfully
or grudgingly.) Let's have a cup of tea, breakfast &mdash; maybe
some greed
is involved, so bad kamma. We sympathize with someone's sickness and
give help &mdash; good kamma. We get flustered because the bus is
late to
take us to work &mdash; bad kamma. Once we're there perhaps we get
impatient
with someone, or angry with them, or threaten them &mdash; worse
and worse
kamma. But perhaps we are generous and kindly to someone there
&mdash;
excellent kamma. Work brings on dull mental states, then we shake
ourselves out of that listlessness and resentment (bad kamma) and
vigorously try to get back to mindfulness (good kamma).</p>
<p>In
the crowded bus returning home someone stamps on
one's foot, one curses &mdash; bad kamma &mdash; but after
quick reflection one
realizes "Ah, no mindfulness" and this is good kamma. At home at last,
one comforts the sick, then plays with the children and tells them some
Jaataka stories &mdash; all good kamma. But then, tired and dull,
one
switches the radio (and/or television) on and, not listening to it,
leaves it going as a sound to drown silence, then one eats too much and
feels lethargic &mdash; bad kamma. But perhaps instead one pays
respect to
the Buddha-image, does some chanting and then meditates &mdash; all
kinds of
good kamma. When the body is tired one goes to sleep holding some
meditation subject in mind &mdash; good kamma.</p>
<p>All
these decisions, choices and desires are kammas
made in the mind. More kamma is made when one talks after having
decided. Still more kamma is added if after this one acts as well.</p>
<p>"Good"
and "bad" kamma are distinguished by <i>the roots</i>
of the actions. What is one's motivating force when one helps the sick?
This is a case where there are various possibilities. Is it just
because one wants rich Aunty's money when she dies, or out of genuine
compassion? Obviously, in the latter case much better kamma is made.
But there are examples where there is no doubt. One's toes are stamped
on and one curses: this can never be good kamma simply because it is <i>rooted
in hatred.</i> Or one gobbles down too much food &mdash; just
<i>greed-rooted</i> kamma in this case. Again those
dull or day-dream periods at work, not looking at things as they are at
all, this is <i>rooted in delusion.</i>
When any of the mentally defiled states of mind has arisen, when these
three "roots of evil" are in control, then bad kamma is sure to be made.</p>
<p>Once
it is made there is no way of erasing it or
changing it and some day or other it will begin to fruit. The fruit of
bad kamma is never happiness, as we can read in these discourses. It
always comes up as pain, anguish, frustration, or the limitation of
opportunities. Who wants them? Then make no more bad kamma! Everyone
has laid in a stock already quite capable of giving rise to sufferings
for lifetimes to come. There is no need to increase it.</p>
<p>Everyone
wants happiness! But it too arises
conditionally. Now a great producer of happiness is the making of good
kamma. What is good about it? It is <i>rooted in non-greed</i>
(generosity, renunciation), or in <i>non-hate</i>
(loving-kindness, compassion) or finally in <i>non-delusion</i>
(wisdom, understanding). The sure way to gain happiness, then, is to
make good kamma, as much as possible every day.</p>
<p>It
is only people who make a real effort to grow in
Dhamma (that is, to make good kamma), who have any chance to succeed in
meditation on the path to final liberation. Whatever one's goal in this
life &mdash; happiness here and now, a good rebirth in the future,
or to end
the whole birth and death process by attainment of Nibbana, one cannot
go wrong by making good kamma.</p>
<p>And
what about those who do not believe in kamma and
its fruits? They still make it whether they believe or not! And they
get the fruits of the kamma they make, too. But the doing, not the
believing, is the important thing.</p>
<p>
"Do good, get good,<br>
do evil, get evil." </p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Majjhima Nikaaya 57<br />
The Dog-duty Ascetic</a><br />
<em>(Kukkuravatika Sutta)</em></p>

<p class="subhd">Introduction</p>

<p>There
were some strange people around in the
Buddha's days believing some strange things &mdash; but that is no
different
from our own days when people still believe the most odd off-balance
ideas. In this sutta we meet some people who believed that by imitating
animals they would be saved. Maybe they're still with us too!</p>
<p>Belief
is often one thing, action another. While
beliefs sometimes influence actions, for other people their beliefs are
quite separate from what they do. But the Buddha says all intentional
actions, whether thoughts, speech or bodily actions, however expressed,
are <i>kamma</i> and lead the doer of them to experience a
result sooner or later. In this sutta the Buddha classifies kamma into
four groups:</p>

<p>(i) dark with a dark result,<br />
(ii) bright with a bright result,<br />
(iii) dark and bright with a dark and bright result,<br />
(iv) neither dark nor bright with a neither dark nor bright result.</p>

<p>Dark
(evil) kamma does not give a bright (happy)
result, nor does bright (beneficial) kamma lead to dark (miserable)
result. Kamma can be mixed, where an action is done with a variety of
motives, some good, some evil. And that kind of kamma also exists which
gives up attachment to and interest in the other three and so leads
beyond the range of kamma.</p>

<p class="center">&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>

<p>1.
Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed
One was living in the Koliyan country: there is a town of the Koliyans
called Haliddavasana.</p>
<p>2.
Then Pu.n.na, a son of the Koliyans and an
ox-duty ascetic, and also Seniya a naked dog duty ascetic, went to the
Blessed One, and
Pu.n.na the ox duty ascetic paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down
at one side, while Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic exchanged
greetings with the Blessed One, and when the courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he too sat down at one side curled up like a dog. When
Pu.n.na the ox-duty ascetic sat down, he asked the Blessed One:
"Venerable sir, this naked dog-duty ascetic Seniya does what is hard to
do: he eats his food when it is thrown on the ground. That dog duty has
long been taken up and practiced by him. What will be his destination?
What will be his future course?"
<sup><a href="BuddhaWords-Kamma.html#n-1" name="b-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>"Enough,
Pu.n.na, let that be. Do not ask me that."</p>
<p>A
second time... A third time Pu.n.na the ox-duty
ascetic asked the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, this naked dog-duty
ascetic Seniya does what is hard to do: he eats his food when it is
thrown on the ground. That dog duty has long been taken up and
practiced by him. What will be his destination? What will be his future
course?"</p>
<p>"Well,
Pu.n.na, since I certainly cannot persuade
you when I say 'Enough, Pu.n.na, let that be. Do not ask me that,' I
shall therefore answer you.</p>
<p>3.
"Here, Pu.n.na, someone develops the dog duty
fully and unstintingly, he develops the dog-habit fully and
unstintingly, he develops the dog mind fully and unstintingly, he
develops dog behavior fully and unstintingly. Having done that, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of
dogs. But if his view is such as this: 'By this virtue or duty or
asceticism or religious life I shall become a (great) god or some
(lesser) god,' that is wrong view in his case. Now there are two
destinations for one with wrong view, I say: hell or the animal womb.
So,
Pu.n.na, if his dog duty is perfected, it will lead him to the company
of dogs; if it is not, it will lead him to hell."</p>
<p>4.
When this was said, Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic wept and shed
tears. Then the Blessed One told
Pu.n.na, son of the Koliyans and an ox-duty ascetic: "Pu.n.na, I could
not persuade you when I said, 'Enough
Pu.n.na, let that be. Do not ask me that.'"</p>
<p>"Venerable
sir, I am not weeping that the Blessed
One has spoken thus. Still, this dog duty has long been taken up and
practiced by me. Venerable sir, there is this
Pu.n.na, a son of the Koliyans and an ox duty ascetic: that ox duty has
long been taken up and practiced by him. What will be his destination?
What will be his future course?"</p>
<p>"Enough,
Seniya, let that be. Do not ask me that." A
second time... A third time Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic asked the
Blessed One: "Venerable sir, there is this
Pu.n.na, a son of the Koliyans and an ox-duty ascetic; that ox duty has
long been taken up and practiced by him. What will be his destination?
What will be his future course?"</p>
<p>"Well,
Seniya, since I certainly cannot persuade you
when I say 'Enough, Seniya, let that be. Do not ask me that,' I shall
therefore answer you."</p>
<p>5.
"Here, Seniya, someone develops the ox duty fully
and unstintingly, he develops the ox habit fully and unstintingly, he
develops the ox mind fully and unstintingly, he develops the ox
behavior fully and unstintingly. Having done that, on the dissolution
of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of oxen. But if
his view is such as this: 'By this virtue or duty or asceticism or
religious like I shall become a (great) god or some (lesser) god,' that
is wrong view in his case. Now there are two destinations for one with
wrong view, I say: hell or the animal womb. So, Seniya, if his ox duty
is perfected, it will lead him to the company of oxen; if it is not, it
will lead him to hell."</p>
<p>6.
When this was said, Pu.n.na, a son of the
Koliyans and an ox-duty ascetic, wept and shed tears. Then the Blessed
One told Seniya, the naked dog duty ascetic: "Seniya, I could not
persuade you when I said, 'Enough, Seniya, let that be. Do not ask me
that.'"</p>
<p>"Venerable
sir, I am not weeping that the Blessed
One has spoken thus. Still, this ox duty has long been taken up and
practiced by me. Venerable sir, I have confidence in the Blessed One
thus: 'The Blessed One is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a
way that I may abandon this ox duty and that this naked dog-duty
ascetic Seniya may abandon that dog duty.'"</p>
<p>7.
"Then, Pu.n.na, listen and heed well what I shall say."</p>
<p>"Yes,
venerable sir," he replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p>8.
"Pu.n.na, there are four kinds of kamma
proclaimed by me after realization myself with direct knowledge. What
are the four? There is dark kamma with dark ripening, there is bright
kamma with bright ripening, there is dark-and-bright kamma with
dark-and-bright ripening, and there is kamma that is not dark and not
bright with neither-dark-nor-bright ripening that conduces to the
exhaustion of kamma.</p>
<p>9.
"What is dark kamma with dark ripening? Here someone produces a
(kammic) bodily process (bound up) with affliction,<sup><a href="BuddhaWords-Kamma.html#n-2" name="b-2">2</a></sup>
he produces a (kammic) verbal process (bound up) with affliction, he
produces a (kammic) mental process (bound up) with affliction. By so
doing, he reappears in a world with affliction. When that happens,
afflicting contacts<sup><a href="BuddhaWords-Kamma.html#n-3" name="b-3">3</a></sup>
touch him. Being touched by these, he feels afflicting feelings
entirely painful as in the case of beings in hell. Thus a being's
reappearance is due to a being: he reappears owing to the kammas he has
performed. When he has reappeared, contacts touch him. Thus I say are
beings heirs of their kammas. This is called dark kamma with dark
ripening.</p>
<p>10.
"And what is bright kamma with bright ripening?
Here someone produces a (kammic) bodily process not (bound up) with
affliction, he produces a (kammic) verbal process not (bound up) with
affliction, he produces a (kammic) mental process not (bound up) with
affliction. By doing so, he reappears in a world without affliction.
When that happens, unafflicting contacts touch him. Being touched by
these, he feels unafflicting feelings entirely pleasant as in the case
of the Subhakinha, the gods of Refulgent Glory. Thus a being's
reappearance is due to a being: he reappears owing to the kammas he has
performed. When he has reappeared, contacts touch him. Thus I say are
beings heirs of their kammas. This is called bright kamma with bright
ripening.</p>
<p>11.
"What is dark-and-bright kamma with
dark-and-bright ripening? Here someone produces a (kammic) bodily
process both (bound up) with affliction and not (bound up) with
affliction... verbal process... mental process both (bound up) with
affliction and not (bound up) with affliction. By doing so, he
reappears in a world both with and without affliction. When that
happens, both afflicting and unafflicting contacts touch him. Being
touched by these, he feels afflicting and unafflicting feelings with
mingled pleasure and pain as in the case of human beings and some gods
and some inhabitants of the states of deprivation. Thus a being's
reappearance is due to a being: he reappears owing to the kammas he has
performed. When he has reappeared, contacts touch him. Thus I say are
beings heirs of their kammas. This is called dark-and-bright kamma with
dark-and-bright ripening.</p>
<p>12.
"What is neither-dark-nor-bright kamma with
neither-dark-nor-bright ripening that leads to the exhaustion of kamma?
As to these (three kinds of kamma), any volition in abandoning the kind
of kamma that is dark with dark ripening, any volition in abandoning
the kind of kamma that is bright with bright ripening, and any volition
in abandoning the kind of kamma that is dark-and bright with
dark-and-bright ripening: this is called neither-dark-nor-bright kamma
with neither-dark-nor-bright ripening.</p>
<p>"These
are the four kinds of kamma proclaimed by me after realization myself
with direct knowledge."</p>
<p>13.
When this was said, Pu.n.na, a son of the
Koliyans and an ox-duty ascetic, said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent,
Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dhamma has been made
clear in many ways by Master Gotama as though he were turning upright
what had been overthrown, revealing the hidden, showing the way to one
who is lost, holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight
to see forms.</p>
<p>14.
"I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the
Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama
remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life."</p>
<p>15.
But Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic said:
"Magnificent, Master Gotama!... The Dhamma has been made clear... for
those with eyesight to see forms.</p>
<p>16.
"I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the
Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would receive the going forth
under Master Gotama and the full admission."<sup><a href="BuddhaWords-Kamma.html#n-4" name="b-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>17.
"Seniya, one who belonged formerly to another
sect and wants the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma
and Discipline lives on probation for four months. At the end of the
four months bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give him the
going forth into homelessness and also the full admission to the
bhikkhus' state. A difference in persons has become known to me in this
(probation period)."</p>
<p>"Venerable
sir, if those who belonged formerly to
another sect and want the going forth and the full admission in this
Dhamma and Discipline live on probation for four months and at the end
of four months bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give them the
going forth into homelessness and the full admission to the bhikkhus'
state, I will live on probation for four years and at the end of the
four years let bhikkhus who are satisfied in their minds give me the
going forth into homelessness and the full admission to the bhikkhus'
state."</p>
<p>18.
Seniya the naked dog duty ascetic received the
going forth under the Blessed One, and he received the full admission.
And not long after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn,
diligent, ardent, and self-controlled, the venerable Seniya by
realization himself with direct knowledge here and now entered upon and
abode in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which
clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. He had
direct knowledge thus: "Birth is exhausted, the holy life has been
lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more of this to
come."</p>
<p>And
the venerable Seniya became one of the arahants.</p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Majjhima Nikaaya 135<br />
The Shorter Exposition of Kamma</a><br />
<em>(Cula-kammavibhanga Sutta)</em></p>

<p class="subhd">Introduction</p>

<p>You
want: long life, health, beauty, power, riches,
high birth, wisdom? Or even some of these things? They do not appear by
chance. It is not someone's luck that they are healthy, or another's
lack of it that he is stupid. Though it may not be clear to us now, all
such inequalities among human beings (and all sorts of beings) come
about because of the kamma they have made individually. Each person
reaps his own fruits. So if one is touched by short life, sickliness,
ugliness, insignificance, poverty, low birth or stupidity and one does
not like these things, no need to just accept that that is the way it
is. The future need not be like that provided that one makes the right
kind of kamma now. Knowing what kamma to make and what not to make is
the mark of a wise man. It is also the mark of one who is no longer
drifting aimlessly but has some direction in life and some control over
the sort of events that will occur.</p>

<p class="center">&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>

<p>1.
Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Saavatthi
in Jeta's Grove, Anaathapi.n.dika's Park.</p>
<p>Then
Subha the student (brahman), Todeyya's son,
went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him, and when the
courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side. When
he had done so, Subha the student said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p>2.
"Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the
condition, why inferiority and superiority are met with among human
beings, among mankind? For one meets with short-lived and long-lived
people, sick and healthy people, ugly and beautiful people,
insignificant and influential people, poor and rich people, low-born
and high-born people, stupid and wise people. What is the reason, what
is the condition, why superiority and inferiority are met with among
human beings, among mankind?"</p>
<p>3.
"Student, beings are owners of kammas, heirs of
kammas, they have kammas as their progenitor, kammas as their kin,
kammas as their homing-place. It is kammas that differentiate beings
according to inferiority and superiority."</p>
<p>4.
"I do not understand the detailed meaning of
Master Gotama's utterance spoken in brief without expounding the
detailed meaning. It would be good if Master Gotama taught me the
Dhamma so that I might understand the detailed meaning of Master
Gotama's utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed
meaning."</p>
<p>"Then
listen, student, and heed well what I shall say."</p>
<p>"Even
so, Master Gotama," Subha the student replied. The Blessed One said
this:</p>
<p>5.
"Here, student, some woman or man is a killer of
living beings, murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence,
merciless to living beings. Due to having performed and completed such
kammas, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a
state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, in hell.
If, on the dissolution of the body, after death, instead of his
reappearing in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in
perdition, in hell, he comes to the human state, he is short-lived
wherever he is reborn. This is the way that leads to short life, that
is to say, to be a killer of living beings, murderous, bloody-handed,
given to blows and violence, merciless to living beings.</p>
<p>6.
"But here some woman or man, having abandoned the
killing of living beings, abstains from killing living beings, lays
aside the rod and lays aside the knife, is considerate and merciful and
dwells compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. Due to
having performed and completed such kammas, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, he reappears in a happy destination, in the heavenly
world. If, on the dissolution of the body, after death, instead of his
reappearing in a happy destination, in the heavenly world, he comes to
the human state, he is long-lived wherever he is reborn. This is the
way that leads to long life, that is to say, to have abandoned the
killing of living beings, to abstain from killing living beings, to lay
aside the rod and lay aside the knife, to be considerate and merciful,
and to dwell compassionate for the welfare of all living beings.</p>
<p>7.
"Here, student, some woman or man is one who
harms beings with his hands or with clods or with sticks or with
knives. Due to having performed and completed such kammas, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of
deprivation... If instead he comes to the human state, he is sickly
wherever he is reborn. This is the way that leads to sickness, that is
to say, to be one who harms beings with one's hands or with clods or
with sticks or with knives.</p>
<p>8.
"But here some woman or man is not one who harms
beings with his hands, or with clods, or with sticks, or with knives.
Due to having performed and completed such kammas, on the dissolution
of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy destination... If
instead he comes to the human state, he is healthy wherever he is
reborn. This is the way that leads to health, that is to say, not to be
one who harms beings with his hands or with clods or with sticks or
with knives.</p>
<p>9.
"Here, student, some woman or man is angry, much
given to rage; even when little is said, he is furious, angry,
ill-disposed, resentful, he shows ill-temper, hate and surliness. Due
to having performed and completed such kammas, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, he reappears in a state of deprivation... If
instead he comes to the human state, he is ugly wherever he is reborn.
This is the way that leads to ugliness, that is to say, to be furious,
angry, ill-disposed, resentful, and to show ill-temper, hate and
surliness.</p>
<p>10.
"But here some woman or man is not angry or much
given to rage; even when much is said, he is not furious, angry,
ill-disposed, resentful, nor does he show ill-temper, hate or
surliness. Due to having performed and completed such kammas, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy
destination... If instead he comes to the human state, he is beautiful
wherever he is reborn. This is the way that leads to beauty, that is to
say, not to be angry or given to much rage; even when much is said, not
to be furious, angry, ill-disposed or resentful, or to show ill-temper,
hate or surliness.</p>
<p>11.
"Here, student, some woman or man is envious; he
envies, begrudges and harbors envy about others' gains, honor,
veneration, respect, salutations and offerings. Due to having performed
and completed such kammas, on the dissolution of the body, after death,
he reappears in a state of deprivation... If instead he comes to the
human state, he is insignificant wherever he is reborn. This is the way
that leads to insignificance, that is to say, to be envious, to envy,
begrudge, and harbor envy about others' gain, honor, veneration,

When this was said, Subha the student, Todeyya's

The Great Exposition of Kamma</a><br>
<em>(Mahakammavibhanga Sutta)</em></p>

<p class="subhd">Introduction</p>

<p>This
celebrated sutta shows some of the complexities
of kamma and its results. Beginning with a strange view expressed by a
confused wanderer and a confused answer given by a bhikkhu, the Buddha
then gives his Great Exposition of Kamma which is based upon four
"types" of people:</p>

<p>i. The evil-doer who goes to hell (or some other low state of birth),<br />
ii. The evil-doer who goes to heaven,<br />
iii. The good man who goes to heaven, and<br />
iv. The good man who goes to hell (or other low birth).</p>

<p>The
Buddha then shows how wrong views can arise from
only partial understanding of truth. One can see the stages of this:
(1) a mystic "sees" in vision an evil-doer suffering in hell, (2) this
confirms what he had heard about moral causality, (3) so he says,
"evil-doers always go to hell," and (4) dogma hardens and becomes rigid
when he says (with the dogmatists of all ages and places), "Only this
is true; anything else is wrong." The stages of this process are
repeated for each of the four "persons," after which the Buddha
proceeds to analyze these views grounded in partial experience and
points out which portions are true (because verifiable by trial and
experience) and which are dogmatic superstructure which is unjustified.
Finally, the Buddha explains his Great Exposition of Kamma in which he
shows that notions of invariability like "the evildoer goes to hell"
are much too simple. The minds of people are complex and they make many
different kinds of kamma even in one lifetime, some of which may
influence the last moment when kamma is made before death, which in
turn is the basis for the next life.</p>

<p class="center">&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>

<p>1.
Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed
One was living at Raajagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels'
Feeding Place. Now on that occasion the venerable Samiddhi was living
in a forest hut.</p>
<p>Then
the wanderer Potaliputta, walking and wandering
for exercise, came to the venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings
with him, and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat
down at one side. When he had done so, he said to the venerable
Samiddhi:</p>
<p>2.
"I heard and learned this, friend Samiddhi, from
the monk Gotama's lips: 'Bodily kammas are vain, verbal kammas are
vain, only mental kammas are true.' But there is actually that
attainment having entered upon which nothing (of result of kammas) is
felt at all."</p>
<p>"Not
so, friend Potaliputta, do not say thus, do not
misrepresent the Blessed One; it is not good to misrepresent the
Blessed One; the Blessed One would not say so: 'Bodily kammas are vain,
verbal kammas are vain, only mental kammas are true.' And there is
actually that attainment having entered upon which nothing (of result
of kammas) is felt at all."</p>
<p>"How
long is it since you went forth, friend Samiddhi?"</p>
<p>"Not
long, friend, three years."</p>
<p>"There
now, what shall we say to the elder bhikkhus,
when the young bhikkhu fancies the Master is to be defended thus? After
doing intentional kamma, friend Samiddhi, by way of body, speech or
mind, what does one feel (of its result)?"</p>
<p>"After
doing an intentional kamma, friend Potaliputta, by way of body, speech
or mind, one feels suffering (as its result)."</p>
<p>Then
neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the words
of the venerable Samiddhi, the wanderer Potaliputta got up from his
seat and went away.</p>
<p>3.
Soon after the wanderer Potaliputta had gone, the
venerable Samiddhi went to the venerable Ananda and exchanged greetings
with him, and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat
down at one side. When he had done so, he told the venerable Ananda all
his conversation with the wanderer Potaliputta.</p>
<p>When
this was said, the venerable Ananda told him:
"Friend Samiddhi, this conversation should be told to the Blessed One.
Come, let us go to the Blessed One, and having done so, let us tell him
about this. As he answers, so we shall bear it in mind."</p>
<p>"Even
so, friend," the venerable Samiddhi replied.</p>
<p>Then
they went together to the Blessed One, and
after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side. When they had
done so, the venerable Ananda told the Blessed One all the venerable
Samiddhi's conversation with the wanderer Potaliputta.</p>
<p>4.
When this was said, the Blessed One told the venerable Ananda:</p>
<p>"I
do not even know the wanderer by sight, Ananda.
How could there have been such a conversation? The wanderer
Potaliputta's question ought to have been answered after analyzing it,
but this misguided man Samiddhi answered it without qualification.
<sup><a href="#n-b1" name="b-b1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>When
this was said, the venerable Udaayin said to
the Blessed One: "'But, venerable sir, supposing when the venerable
Samiddhi spoke, he was referring to this, namely, 'Whatever is felt is
suffering.'"<sup><a href="#n-b2" name="b-b2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>5.
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable
Ananda: "See, Ananda, how this misguided man
Udaayin interferes. I knew, Ananda, that this misguided man Udaayin
would unreasonably interfere now. To begin with it was the three kinds
of feeling that were asked about by the wanderer Potaliputta. If, when
this misguided man Samiddhi was asked, he had answered the wanderer
Potaliputta thus: 'After doing an intentional kamma by way of body,
speech and mind (whose result is) to be felt as pleasure, he feels
pleasure; after doing an intentional kamma by way of body, speech and
mind (whose result is) to be felt as pain, he feels pain; after doing
an intentional kamma by way of body, speech and mind (whose result is)
to be felt as neither-pain-nor-pleasure, he feels
neither-pain-nor-pleasure' &mdash; by answering him thus, Ananda,
the
misguided man Samiddhi would have given the wanderer Potaliputta the
right answer. Besides, Ananda, who are the foolish thoughtless
wanderers of other sects that they will understand the
Tathaagata's Great Exposition of Kamma? (But) if you, Ananda, would
listen to the
Tathaagata expounding the Great Exposition of Kamma (you might
understand it).<sup><a href="#n-b3" name="b-b3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>"This
is the time, Blessed One, this is the time,
Sublime One, for the Blessed One to expound the Great Exposition of
Kamma. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will bear it
in mind."</p>
<p>"Then
listen, Ananda, and heed well what I shall say."</p>
<p>"Even
so, venerable sir," the venerable Ananda replied. The Blessed One said
this:</p>
<p>6.
"Ananda, there are four kinds of persons existing in the world. What
four?</p>

<p>(i) "Here some person kills living beings, takes
what is not given, misconducts himself in sexual desires, speaks
falsehood, speaks maliciously, speaks harshly, gossips, is covetous, is
ill-willed, and has wrong view.<sup><a href="#n-b4" name="b-b4">4</a></sup> 
On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in the states
of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, in hell.</p>

<p>(ii) "But here some person kills living beings...
and has wrong view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, he
reappears in a happy destination, in the heavenly world.</p>

<p>(iii) "Here some person abstains from killing living
beings, from taking what is not given, from misconduct in sexual
desires, from false speech, from malicious speech, from harsh speech,
from gossip, he is not covetous, is not ill-willed, and has right view.<sup><a href="#n-b5" name="b-b5">5</a></sup> On the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy
destination, in the heavenly world.</p>

<p>(iv) "But here some person abstains from killing
living beings... and has right view. On the dissolution of the body,
after death, he reappears in the states of deprivation, in an unhappy
destination, in perdition, in hell.</p>

<p>7. (i) "Here, Ananda, in consequence of ardor,
endeavor, devotion, diligence, and right attention, some monk or
brahman attains such concentration of mind that, when his mind is
concentrated, he sees with the heavenly eyesight, which is purified and
surpasses the human, that some person kills living beings here, takes
what is not given, misconducts himself in sexual desires, speaks
falsehood, speaks maliciously, speaks harshly, gossips, is covetous, is
ill-willed, has wrong view. He sees that on the dissolution of the
body, after death, he has reappeared in the states of deprivation, in

<a name="n-b3"></a>
<p><b>3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an addition necessary for understanding this sentence. <a href="#b-b3">[Back]</a></p>

<a name="n-b6"></a>
<p><b>6</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This amounts to the belief in theistic religions where virtue and faith
(=whatever is held to be right view) are supposed to guarantee
salvation. <a href="#b-b6">[Back]</a></p>
<a name="n-b7"></a>
<p><b>7</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Devadatta, for instance, who persuaded prince
Ajaatasattu to murder his father (who was a stream-winner), three times
attempted to murder the Buddha and once succeeded in wounding him, and
caused a schism in the Sangha; the last two actions are certain to lead
to birth in hell. <a href="#b-b7">[Back]</a></p>
<a name="n-b8"></a>
<p><b>8</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of three phrases appears to mean: <i>earlier,</i>
either earlier in life before he undertook either the wholesome or
unwholesome courses of kamma, or in some previous life; <i>later,</i>
later in that very life, for even if a person does much evil kamma,
usually he will also make some good kamma occasionally; <i>wrong
view... time of his death,</i>
this kind of wrong view will be of the type, "there is no kamma, no
results of kamma, no evil, no results of evil," and so on. The next
birth actually depends on the object of the last moments of a dying
person's consciousness. At that time one should recollect all one's
good kamma: generosity, loving-kindness, compassion, pure precepts and
so on. Evil should not be thought of then though heavy evil kamma done
previously may force itself into the mind and make recollection of
one's generosity and virtue in keeping the precepts difficult or
impossible. <a href="#b-b8">[Back]</a></p>
<a name="n-b9"></a>
<p><b>9</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example of this is the story of "Coppertooth," the public
executioner who, after a career of murder as a bandit, then as the
killer of his own bandit comrades and subsequently executioner of all
criminals for fifty years, was taught by venerable Sariputta Thera and
his mind eased of the heavy weight of evil kamma so that he attained
heavenly rebirth. See Dhammapada Commentary, ii, 203-209. <a href="#b-b9">[Back]</a></p>
<a name="n-b10"></a>
<p><b>10</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though such a person attained a heavenly rebirth the evil kamma made
will still mature sooner or later; he has not escaped its results. <a href="#b-b10">[Back]</a></p>
<a name="n-b11"></a>
<p><b>11</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;King Pasenadi of Kosala, for instance. <a href="#b-b11">[Back]</a></p>
<a name="n-b12"></a>
<p><b>12</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was what happened to Queen
Mallikaa, wife of King Pasenadi, who had led a good life, generous,
keeping the Five Precepts, and the Eight Precepts on Uposatha days and
so on, but once she did evil, having sexual relations with a dog. This
unconfessed evil weighed heavily on her mind and she remembered it when
dying. As a result she spent seven days in hell. Her power of goodness
from the doing of many good kammas then gave her rebirth in a heavenly
world. See Dhammapada Commentary, iii, 119-123. <a href="#b-b12">[Back]</a></p>
<a name="n-b13"></a>
<p><b>13</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this virtuous and good person has obtained a low rebirth through
the power of previously done evil kamma, still the good kamma made by
him will mature sooner or later, when it gets a chance. <a href="#b-b13">[Back]</a></p>
<a name="n-b14"></a>
<p><b>14</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This final terse paragraph may have been clear to the venerable Ananda
Thera, or he may have asked for an explanation, as we require and find
in the Commentary, which says:</p>

<p><b>i.</b> A strong unwholesome kamma (incapable of good result), the
result of which will come before the results of weaker unwholesome
kammas.</p>
<p><b>ii.</b> Wholesome kamma (which appears capable
of good result) is followed by unwholesome death-proximate kamma which
makes the former incapable of good result immediately.</p>
<p><b>iii.</b> A strong wholesome kamma will mature even before much
accumulated unwholesome kamma.</p>
<p><b>iv.</b> &nbsp;Unwholesome kamma (which appears incapable
of good result) is followed by wholesome death-proximate kamma which
will mature first and is capable of good results. <a href="#b-b14">[Back]</a></p>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Majjhima Nikaaya 41<br />
The Brahmans of Saalaa</a><br />
<em>(Saleyyaka Sutta)</em></p>

<p class="subhd">Introduction</p>
<p>The
brahmans of this discourse, intelligent people,
asked a question about the causality of rebirth &mdash; why is one
reborn in
the states of deprivation (the hells, animals, and ghosts) while others
make it to the heaven worlds?</p>
<p>The
Buddha then analyzes what kind of kamma will
take one to a low rebirth. You see any of your own actions here? Then
you know what to do about it, for if one makes any of these ten courses
of unwholesome kamma strong in oneself, a result can be expected at
least "on the dissolution of the body, after death," if not in this
life.</p>
<p>The
ten courses of wholesome kamma follow. They
should be strengthened in oneself, repeated frequently so that they
become habitual. If one recognizes any of one's own actions among them,
then just guard against the conceit: "I am good."</p>
<p>The
last part of the sutta deals with the
aspirations which one may have for rebirth at the time of death. Of
course, one's previously made kamma must be such that it will support
such aspirations. A miser might aspire to riches but his kamma will
give him poverty. If a person has kept the Uposatha and generally all
the precepts and been generous and truthful as well, this is the
passport to heavenly birth (from the gods of the Four Kings up to the
gods that Wield Power over others' Creations). Beyond this, it is
necessary also to be proficient in
jhaana and one will gain rebirth among the Brahmaas (from the
Divinity's Retinue to the Very Fruitful gods) according to proficiency
in this. For the next five Brahma-planes, the state of nonreturning is
required, while for the last four one must have gained the formless
attainments. Finally, one may aspire to no rebirth: to arahantship, but
of course the aspiration alone is not sufficient &mdash; practice
and
sufficient insight-wisdom are needed.</p>

<p class="center">&bull; &bull; &bull;</p>

<p>1.
Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the
Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually he
arrived at a Kosalan brahman village called
Saalaa.</p>
<p>2.
The brahman householders of Saalaa heard: "A monk
called Gotama, it seems, a son of the Sakyans who went forth from a
Sakyan clan, has been wandering in the Kosalan country with a large
Sangha of bhikkhus and has come to
Saalaa. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this
effect: 'That Blessed One is such since he is arahant and Fully
Enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of
worlds, incomparable teacher of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and
humans, enlightened, blessed. He describes this world with its gods,
its
Maaras, and its (Brahma) Divinities, this generation with its monks and
brahmans, with its kings and its people, which he has himself realized
through direct knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the
beginning, good in the middle and good in the end with (the right)
meaning and phrasing, he affirms a holy life that is utterly perfect
and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants."</p>
<p>3.
The brahman householders of Saalaa went to the
Blessed One; and some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at
one side; some exchanged greetings with him, and when the courteous and
amiable talk was finished, sat down at one side; some raised hands
palms together in salutation to the Blessed One and sat down at one
side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's presence
and sat down at one side; some kept silence and sat down at one side.</p>
<p>4.
When they were seated, they said to the Blessed
One: "Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the condition, why
some beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear
in states of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even
in hell; and what is the reason, what is the condition, why some beings
here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world?"</p>
<p>5.
"Householders, it is by reason of conduct not in
accordance with the Dhamma, by reason of unrighteous conduct, that
beings here on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in
states of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in
hell. It is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, by
reason of righteous conduct, that some beings here on the dissolution
of the body, after death, reappear in a happy destination, even in the
heavenly world."</p>
<p>6.
"We do not understand the detailed meaning of
this utterance of Master Gotama's spoken in brief without expounding
the detailed meaning. It would be good if Master Gotama taught us the
Dhamma so that we might understand the detailed meaning of Master
Gotama's utterance spoken in brief without expounding the detailed
meaning."</p>
<p>"Then,
householders, listen and heed well what I shall say."</p>
<p>"Yes,
venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p>7.
"Householders, there are three kinds of bodily
conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct. There
are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma,
unrighteous conduct. There are three kinds of mental conduct not in
accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.</p>
<p>8.
"And how are there three kinds of bodily conduct
not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone is
a killer of living beings: he is murderous, bloody-handed, given to
blows and violence, and merciless to all living beings. He is a taker
of what is not given: he takes as a thief another's chattels and
property in the village or in the forest. He is given over to
misconduct in sexual desires: he has intercourse with such (women) as
are protected by the mother, father, (mother and father), brother,
sister, relatives, as have a husband, as entail a penalty, and also
with those that are garlanded in token of betrothal. That is how there
are three kinds of bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma,
unrighteous conduct.</p>
<p>9.
"And how are there four kinds of verbal conduct
not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone
speaks falsehood: when summoned to a court or to a meeting, or to his
relatives' presence, or to his guild, or to the royal family's
presence, and questioned as a witness thus, 'So, good man, tell what
you know,' then, not knowing, he says 'I know,' or knowing, he says 'I
do not know,' not seeing, he says 'I see,' or seeing, he says 'I do not
see'; in full awareness he speaks falsehood for his own ends or for
another's ends or for some trifling worldly end. He speaks maliciously:
he is a repeater elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of
causing division from these, or he is a repeater to these of what is
heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing division from those, and he
is thus a divider of the united, a creator of divisions, who enjoys
discord, rejoices in discord, delights in discord, he is a speaker of
words that create discord. He speaks harshly: he utters such words as
are rough, hard, hurtful to others, censorious of others, bordering on
anger and unconducive to concentration. He is a gossip: as one who
tells that which is unseasonable, that which is not fact, that which is
not good, that which is not the Dhamma, that which is not the
Discipline, and he speaks out of season speech not worth recording,
which is unreasoned, indefinite, and unconnected with good. That is how
there are four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance with the
Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.</p>
<p>10.
"And how are there three kinds of mental conduct
not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone is
covetous: he is a coveter of another's chattels and property thus: 'Oh,
that what is another's were mine!' Or he has a mind of ill-will, with
the intention of a mind affected by hate thus: 'May these beings be
slain and slaughtered, may they be cut off, perish, or be annihilated!'
Or he has wrong view, distorted vision, thus: 'There is nothing given,
nothing offered, nothing sacrificed, no fruit and ripening of good and
bad kammas, no this world, no other world, no mother, no father, no
spontaneously (born) beings,<sup><a href="#n-c1" name="b-c1">1</a></sup>
no good and virtuous monks and brahmans that have themselves realized
by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.'<sup><a href="#n-c2" name="b-c2">2</a></sup> That
is how there are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with
the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.</p>
<p>"So,
householders, it is by reason of conduct not in
accordance with the Dhamma, by reason of unrighteous conduct, that some
beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in
states of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in
hell.</p>
<p>11.
"Householders, there are three kinds of bodily
conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct. There are
four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous
conduct. There are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct.</p>
<p>12.
"And how are there three kinds of bodily conduct
in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone,
abandoning the killing of living beings, becomes one who abstains from
killing living beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gentle and
kindly, he abides compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the
taking of what is not given, he becomes one who abstains from taking
what is not given; he does not take as a thief another's chattels and
property in the village or in the forest. Abandoning misconduct in
sexual desires, he becomes one who abstains from misconduct in sexual
desires: he does not have intercourse with such women as are protected
by mother, father, (father and mother), brother, sister, relatives, as
have a husband, as entail a penalty, and also those that are garlanded
in token of betrothal. That is how there are three kinds of bodily
conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct.</p>
<p>13.
"And how are there four of verbal conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone, abandoning
false speech, becomes one who abstains from false speech: when summoned
to a court or to a meeting or to his relatives' presence or to his
guild or to the royal family's presence, and questioned as a witness
thus, 'So, good man, tell what you know,' not knowing, he says 'I do
not know,' or knowing, he says 'I know,' not seeing he says 'I do not
see,' or seeing, he says 'I see'; he does not in full awareness speak
falsehood for his own ends or for another's ends or for some trifling
worldly end. Abandoning malicious speech, he becomes one who abstains
from malicious speech: as one who is neither a repeater elsewhere of
what is heard here for the purpose of causing division from these, nor
a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of
causing division from those, who is thus a reuniter of the divided, a
promoter of friendships, enjoying concord, rejoicing in concord,
delighting in concord, he becomes a speaker of words that promote
concord. Abandoning harsh speech, he becomes one who abstains from
harsh speech: he becomes a speaker of such words as are innocent,
pleasing to the ear and lovable, as go to the heart, are civil, desired
of many and dear to many. Abandoning gossip, he becomes one who
abstains from gossip: as one who tells that which is seasonable, that
which is factual, that which is good, that which is the Dhamma, that
which is the Discipline, he speaks in season speech worth recording,
which is reasoned, definite and connected with good. That is how there
are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma,
righteous conduct.</p>
<p>14.
"And how are there three kinds of mental conduct
in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone is not
covetous: he is not a coveter of another's chattels and property thus:
'Oh, that what is another's were mine!' He has no mind of ill-will,
with the intention of a mind unaffected by hate thus: 'May these beings
be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety, may they live happily!' He
has right view, undistorted vision, thus: 'There is what is given and
what is offered and what is sacrificed, and there is fruit and ripening
of good and bad kammas, and there is this world and the other world and
mother and father and spontaneously (born) beings, and good and
virtuous monks and brahmans that have themselves realized by direct
knowledge and declared this world and the other world.' That is how
there are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma,
righteous conduct.</p>
<p>"So,
householders, it is by reason of conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, by reason of righteous conduct, that some
beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a
happy destination, even in the heavenly world.</p>
<p>15.
"If a householder who observes conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that
on the dissolution of the body, after death, I might reappear in the
company of the warrior-nobles of great property!' it is possible that
on the dissolution of the body, after death, he may do so. Why is that?
Because he observes conduct that is in accordance with the Dhamma,
righteous conduct.</p>
<p>16.
"If a householder who observes conduct is
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that
on the dissolution of the body, after death, I might reappear in the
company of the brahmans of great property!' it is possible...</p>
<p>17.
"If a householder who observes conduct in

householders of great property!' it is possible...</p>
<p>18.

on the dissolution of the body, after death, I might reappear in the
company of the gods of the Four Kings!' it is possible that on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he may do so. Why is that?
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous

<p>43.
"If a householder who observes conduct in

enter upon and abide in the deliverance of the heart and the
deliverance by wisdom that are taint-free with exhaustion of taints.
Why is that? Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma,
righteous conduct."</p>
<p>44.
When this was said, the brahman householders of Saalaa said to the
Blessed One:</p>
<p>"Magnificent,
Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master
Gotama! The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama,
as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing
the hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, holding up a lamp in
the darkness for those with eyes to see forms.</p>
<p>45.
"We go to Master Gotama for refuge, and to the
Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama
accept us as followers who have gone to him for refuge for life."</p>
