<strong>Matter (Rupa-khandha)<br>

Mental formations and mental factors
(Sankhara-khandha)<br>
Consciousness (Vinnana-khandha)</strong><br>
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<p>
The five khandhas are the components of a person or being.
They are: matter, feeling, perception, consciousness and
mental formations. In truth, a person is nothing more than
this collection of aggregates. These five phenomena are
impersonal, unsatisfactory and impermanent.
</p>
<p>
The khandhas are called 'groups of clinging'
because everyone grasps at them as belonging to self. Yet
the Buddha taught that, "Whatever there is of
corporeality, feeling, perception, mental formations and
consciousness, whether past, present or future, one's
own or external, gross or subtle, lofty or low, far or
near, this one should understand according to reality and
true wisdom: 'This does not belong to me, this I am
not, this is not my Ego.'" (S. XXII, 49).
</p>
<p>
Suffering results when we cling to the khandhas, mistaking
them for aspects of the ego. If we could cease taking the
body, feeling, memory, consciousness and mental formations
for self, or the property of self, we could live with
ease. A person who gives up attachment to the khandhas
realizes nibbana, complete freedom from suffering. Nibbana
is called, "supramundane happiness."
</p>
<p>
The five khandhas are with us from the moment of birth
until we die. Together they constitute the first of the
vipassana bhumis. 'Vipassana' means insight.
'Bhumi' means a field or land. Since we already
have these five 'fields' - matter, feeling,
perception, consciousness and mental formations - we ought
to plant something in them. We can plant the seeds of
mindfulness or the seeds of concentration, depending on
what kind of crop we want.
</p>

<p class="hd">1. Corporeality-group (Rupa-Khandha)</p>

<p>Materiality is the first khandha. It is called
'rupa.' A human body contains twenty-eight kinds
of matter. The rupa-khandha includes the four elements
earth, water, fire, and air (pathavi, apo, tejo, vayo).
Each element has four characteristics: color, smell,
taste, and nutriment (vanna, gandha, rasa, oja). Every
part of the body possesses the four elements, along with
their four characteristics. Even a single hair contains
the air, earth, fire and water elements. A single hair
also has the attributes of color, smell, taste, and
nutriment.
</p>
<p>
It is the nature of rupa, corporeality, to change or
disappear according to conditions. For example, when the
temperature is too hot or too cold, certain types of
matter cannot survive.
</p>

<p class="hd">2. Feeling-group (Vedana-Khandha)</p>

<p>The vedana-khandha includes painful, pleasant, and neutral
feelings. Feeling can be triggered by changing conditions
in the body, or it can arise from the mind itself.
</p>

<p class="hd">3. Perception-group (Sanna-Khandha)</p>

<p>Because of perception and memory, we are able to retain
the names of things. We can also remember whether a
sense-impression is good or bad. Whenever the eye sees,
the nose smells, the tongue tastes, the ear hears, the
mind thinks or the body touches something, memory is
present to know what was seen, smelled, tasted, heard,
thought or touched.
</p>

<p class="hd">4. Mental Formations-group (Sankhara-Khandha)</p>

<p>Here, the word 'sankhara' refers to the fifty
mental factors (cetasikas) other than feeling and
perception. Some mental formations, such as volition,
contact and attention, accompany every moment of
consciousness. Others appear only occasionally. Some are
wholesome, some, unwholesome. The wholesome
mental-formations include: mindfulness, compassion, and
wisdom.
</p>
<p>
Unless we practice mindfulness, in daily life we have
unwholesome mental formations most of the time. After
perceiving an object and judging it as desirable or not,
attraction or aversion takes over, causing you to describe
the form further. (Attraction and aversion are but milder
forms of greed and hatred.) In judging the object as
pleasant, you feel excited and you cling to it. If the
object is unpleasant, you feel aversion toward it.
Thereafter, every time you think about that object, your
liking or disliking grows stronger.
</p>
<p>
The mental descriptions, and the resulting attachment and
aversion, are a kind of pollution in the mind that
prevents you from seeing reality as it is. That pollution
accumulates all the time unless you practice mindfulness.
The khandha of mental formations is different for all
beings because the amount of mental pollution varies with
each person.
</p>
<p>
On the wholesome side, whenever you pay attention to the
present moment you're cultivating mindfulness, which
leads to wisdom. The mind that stays in the now can't
wander or daydream. Descriptions are not accumulated;
preferences can't intensify. Liking and disliking
decrease until at last reality shines through clearly.
</p>

<p class="hd">5. Consciousness-Group (Vinnana-Khandha)</p>

<p>Thinking is the activity of consciousness. Consciousness
receives and knows the objects of experience, both mental
and physical. There are many types of consciousness. Some
have desire, anger or delusion as their 'root.'
Some types have a wholesome root. These may result in
beneficial action, speech or thought. Some are neither
wholesome nor unwholesome. Ethically neutral types of
consciousness are called 'rootless.' Consciousness
can serve as an object of mindfulness when we observe the
act of thinking itself, instead of the content of the
thought.
</p>
<p>
Consciousness either augments the impurities in the mind
or else actively eliminates them. Until the highest level
of enlightenment, the mind never remains at status quo. A
person can eliminate mental pollutants by observing the
mind and its objects (those things of which the mind is
aware) with mindfulness.
</p>

<p class="hd">Khandhas Past and Present</p>

<p>
We can talk about the khandhas in two ways: 1) as coming
from the past; that is, the khandhas that result from
previous karma (vipaka-khandha); and 2) as existing in the
present moment.
</p>
<p>
The Khandhas from the Past: Objects of Concentration<br>
'Vipaka' means result, the result of intentional
actions previously performed. Vipaka-khandhas come from
the good or bad actions (karma) performed in the past,
whether during this life or in previous lifetimes.
Everyone has the same five khandhas that result from past
karma: material form, feeling, memory, consciousness and
mental formations.
</p>
<p>
The first moment of consciousness is called
'patisandhi' in Pali. Karma causes this moment of
consciousness - the first moment of your life - to arise.
Because of karma you're born here on this earth with
this particular body, instead of being born somewhere else
with a different form. The body's four elements, air,
earth, fire, and water, comprise the material khandha that
results from past karma.
</p>
<p>
Buddhism teaches that all beings are reborn over and over
again in the wheel of birth and death. There is no end to
this cycle of rebirth until a person eliminates the greed,
hatred and delusion in his or her mind. At times during
this faring-on you have a pleasant rebirth, at other times
an unpleasant one. The quality of your life depends on the
kinds of actions you perform.
</p>
<p>
The Buddha taught that all beings have performed good and
bad actions in the past. That means that everyone has a
store of both good and bad karma waiting to give a result
when conditions allow. If someone enjoys the result of
good karma, he or she will be healthy and good-looking.
The material-khandha will possess all thirty-two parts and
twenty-eight rupas mentioned in the Pali texts. It's
because of wholesome karma that someone is born with a
complete physical form, including functioning eyes, ears,
nose, tongue, and tactile sensitivity, and a complete
mental apparatus.
</p>
<p>
If someone experiences the result of bad kamma, he or she
will be reborn without all thirty-two body parts as, for
example, someone born handicapped. Although the person
'spends' the unwholesome karma during his
lifetime, the result of that karma does not last forever.
When the person is reborn again, a different karma will
give a result. That new karma may very well be a wholesome
one, giving rise to a healthy body and pleasant
life-circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, someone who is now spending the result of good
karma, as evidenced by good health, may be reborn into an
unpleasant state in his next lifetime. It depends, in
part, on whether the person performs wholesome or
unwholesome actions now, in the present lifetime. It also
depends on when a particular karma has a chance to
manifest. The wheel never stops turning. The Pali Canon
tells of a young woman named Sumana who was variously
reborn as a hen, a heavenly being, a pig, and a princess
as part of a long series of rebirths. She eventually
attained enlightenment and was no longer reborn in
samsara.
</p>
<p>
When good karma gives its result, a person will also enjoy
pleasant feeling and memories, have good mental formations
and a wholesome consciousness or mind. The difference in
body, mind and circumstances among human beings is a
result of having performed different bodily, verbal and
mental actions in the past. So the way to gain happiness
is to perform wholesome actions now, because those actions
will result in pleasant experiences, either in this
lifetime or the next.
</p>
<p>
Everyone clings to the material khandha that results from
previous karma or action. We believe, out of ignorance,
that the body belongs to us, thinking: "My leg, my
head, my hand, my eye, my tongue."
</p>
<p>
We were born with this body or corporeal khandha. It is
already formed. Some people use the physical body itself
as a subject of meditation. However, the corporeal
structure of the body can only be used as an object for
developing concentration, whereas the material-khandha
that arises in the present moment can be used to develop
mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
According to the Buddhist tradition, a new monk learns to
develop concentration by focusing on the following
body-parts: head-hair (desa), body-hair (lobha),
fingernails (laha), teeth (kanto) and skin (dajo). These
are the visible parts of the body. The monk concentrates
on their characteristics, such as the color of the hair,
its smell, taste and nutriment, in order to see how these
visible body-parts change. For instance, he might think
about the fact that the hair changes color from black to
gray. He concentrates on the characteristics of matter in
order to see impermanence and nonselfness.
</p>
<p>
But the hair never knows that it's hair. The teeth and
skin are not aware of themselves. We cling to these
things, believing that they belong to us. But in fact they
simply exist according to the laws that govern physical
phenomena. Eventually they disappear, separating into the
elements earth, air, fire, and water. In the conventional
sense, we know that our own hair and skin differ from
someone else's. But in the ultimate sense, hair,
teeth, skin and so forth do not belong to any individual
but only to cause and effect and natural, physical laws.
</p>
<p>
Meditating on hair, fingernails, teeth and skin develops
concentration. When contemplating the parts of the body
(the rupa-khandha that results from past karma), we
can't be said to be practicing mindfulness, because
the various body parts are not meditation objects for
destroying greed, hatred and delusion. In order to
eliminate those mental impurities, a deep understanding of
impermanence, unsatisfactoriness or nonselfness is needed.
And that depends on the direct insight gained from
mindfulness practice.
</p>
<p>
The Khandhas of the Present: Objects of Mindfulness<br>
If you want to develop mindfulness and eliminate mental
pollutants, you have to observe the khandhas as they arise
in the present moment. Unless you're trying to develop
concentration, it won't be useful to contemplate the
khandhas that are already formed.
</p>
<p>
Although you can't use the thirty-two parts of the
body for developing mindfulness, you can use the
material-khandha that arises in the present moment. That
khandha is a correct object of mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
The material- or rupa-khandha in the present moment refers
to the movement and posture of the body. Sitting is rupa,
standing is rupa, walking is rupa, lying down is rupa.
Whichever posture your body is adopting now is
rupa-khandha in the present moment. You are never without
bodily posture.
</p>
<p>
The agent that knows that the body is sitting is nama,
which means mind. The mind is the faculty that knows an
object. It is nama, the mind, that knows when you are
standing, walking or lying down. A rupa (material form) is
always known by nama.
</p>
<p>
'The Body in the Body'<br>
<br>
The four postures and the motion of the body are called
'kaya vinnatti rupa,' meaning, 'bodily
expression.' 'Bodily expression' or movement
is that aspect of the body that originates from the mind,
in the present time. Whereas the physical form itself
results from karma, i.e., from actions performed in the
relatively distant past, the physical movement that we
experience in the present moment comes from concurrent
volitions in the mind.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Satipatthana Sutta</em> tells us to observe
'the body in the body,' that is, the body as it
occurs in the present moment of activity. The 'body in
the body' doesn't refer to the elements within the
head, hand or leg. We don't observe to find out what
is physically inside the material frame - the bones,
muscles, and arteries. The corporeal elements in the head
and limbs are not appropriate objects of mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
'The body in the body' means 'bodily
expression' or movement. It includes posture. Posture
is an outward expression of a simultaneous mental
volition. In order to develop mindfulness we should
observe the body's motion and posture.
</p>
<p>
The sitting posture itself is 'in the body.' So
are the standing and lying down postures. And physical
movement of any kind is 'in the body.' These
postures and actions belong to the rupa-khandha of the
present moment. By mindfully observing the posture or
motion of the body, it is possible to eliminate the wrong
view that rupa is self or the property of self.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if we observe the corporeal elements in
the limbs, we'll cling to the physical form and
believe, 'that's my leg, or my arm' wrongly
viewing the material phenomenon as belonging to an ego.
</p>
<p>
So it's necessary to understand how the objects of
mindfulness differ from traditional concentration objects.
Again, the appropriate body objects for mindfulness are:
1) bodily movement; and, 2) posture: sitting, standing,
walking, and lying down.
</p>
<p>
The five khandhas can be reclassified into two categories:
1) those that are comprised of material phenomena (rupa),
and 2) those comprised of mental phenomena (nama). The
materiality-group belongs to the first category, of
course. The other four groups - feeling, perception,
consciousness and mental formations - are nama, mental
phenomena. In the practice of mindfulness we observe nama,
mental phenomena, and rupa, material phenomena, in the
present moment.
</p>
<p>
The second khandha is feeling (vedana-khandha). You can
observe feeling as it arises in the present moment. Viewed
in that way, feeling becomes an object with which to
develop mindfulness. Observing vedana-khandha in the
present moment means: When you sit, how do you feel? When
you stand, how do you feel? When you walk, how do you
feel? When you're moving the hand, or bending the
body, how do you feel? Is the feeling pleasant, unpleasant
or neutral?
</p>
<p>
The consciousness-group (vinnana-khandha) is present
whenever you experience a form. If you're practicing
mindfulness of the sitting posture, for example,
consciousness 'receives' the object. Consciousness
knows the form of the posture.
</p>
<p>
Perception, or memory (sanna-khandha), remembers that you
are sitting, not standing. And the contact between an
object and the mind, the act of attending to the object,
and the volition that turns the mind toward the object,
all belong to the khandha of mental formations
(sankhara-khandha).
</p>
<p>
"Whatever, O brother, there exists of feeling, of
perception and of mental formations, these things are
associated, not dissociated, and it is impossible to
separate one from the other and show their difference. For
whatever one feels, one perceives; and whatever one
perceives, of this one is conscious." (M. 43).
</p>
<p>
All five khandhas appear together in the present moment.
How? When you're aware of the body walking
step-by-step, it is the mind - consciousness and mental
factors - that knows the act of walking (vinnana-khandha).
Furthermore, feeling will arise as you walk; that's
vedana-khandha. The walking-meditation exercise has six
different steps; when you remember which step you're
executing, perception is manifest (sanna-khandha). When
wholesome mental formations are present, you have
mindfulness to know the object (sankhara-khandha). The
material-khandha is present, too, because the action of
walking is a material phenomenon. Those are the khandhas
of walking in the present moment.
</p>
<p>
If unwholesome mental formations are present, liking or
disliking will arise when you're walking. During the
practice of mindfulness we try to interrupt the stream of
consciousness before liking and disliking occur. That
isn't done by forcing the mind, but simply by
returning it to the present again and again. Liking and
disliking only arise when the mind drifts away from the
present moment.
</p>
<p>
But if mindfulness is strong it will be able to observe
materiality, feeling, perception or consciousness before
the mind develops liking or disliking for the object. In
that case, unwholesome mental formations will not have a
chance to generate preferences.
</p>

<p class="hd">The Five Senses</p>

<p>The five
sense-impressions - color, sound, smell, taste, and touch
- also belong to the first khandha, the group of matter.
These sensations can be used to develop mindfulness, since
we can know them as they arise in the present. The
meditator can be aware of the act of seeing as it arises
and passes away.
</p>
<p>
Color is rupa, matter. The agent that sees the color is
consciousness. The feeling that arises from seeing a
beautiful or ugly image is a function of the
feeling-khandha. Remembering the name of the image is the
perception-khandha. The contact that happens when the
object 'touches' the mind is the
mental-formations-khandha. All five khandhas are involved
when seeing occurs. It's the same with hearing,
tasting, touching, and smelling.
</p>
<p>
When the eye sees color, the khandhas of matter,
consciousness, feeling, perception and mental-factors
appear simultaneously. But when you practice mindfulness,
don't try to observe all five khandhas at once. Just
observe one khandha at a time and let it go. Don't
think about the way you feel. Don't describe the form
you're observing. There's no need to evaluate the
objects you perceive. Be aware of the sense-impression,
motion, feeling or thought as it appears and then drop it.
After letting it go, observe the next object. Don't
continue to think about the first one. Focus and forget
it. Observe one object, let it go, then observe the next.
</p>
<p>
When the ear hears a sound, for example, only be aware
that sound is rupa, material form. Being aware of sound is
not the same as thinking, "sound is rupa." You
don't need to repeat a word or phrase. Just know the
experience. Don't try to find out where the sound came
from, or why. Just observe the phenomenon of hearing as it
arises and passes away.
</p>
<p>
The five khandhas can become objects for developing
mindfulness if you continue to keep your attention on the
next object that's arising in the present. If you
practice in this way you'll gain the wisdom to see
reality as it is.
</p>

<p class="hd">Conclusion</p>

<p>Observing the khandhas in the
present moment is the way to diminish mental pollution
until it's cleared from the mind. That's why we
have to understand the khandhas. If we continue observing
vipaka-khandha, the body that results from past kamma, we
only develop concentration.
</p>
<p>
Only the mental and material phenomena (namas and rupas)
that arise in the present moment are valid objects for
developing mindfulness. In insight meditation we
distinguish motion and posture from corporeal form. The
primary objects that we observe are: bodily movement,
sitting, standing, walking, and lying down. The additional
objects of contemplation are: seeing, hearing smelling,
tasting, touching, feeling, and thinking.
</p>
<p>
Your physical form is the result of actions performed long
ago. But the movement and deportment of the body, which
are also material phenomena (rupa), result from volitions
in the mind. These volitions occur simultaneously with the
movement. That is one difference between the two kinds of
matter, i.e., the corporeal form and its activity. When
practicing mindfulness we observe, from moment-to-moment,
the activity of the body that is occurring right now.
</p>
<p>
When you can distinguish motion from the corporeal
elements and observe the former in your daily activities,
you are practicing mindfulness. Simply observe each
moment, each movement, then let it go. Apply the same
procedure to sights, sounds, smells, touches, tastes,
feelings and thoughts. In that way the five khandhas will
become a vast field for mindfulness, leading to the fruit
of nibbana. We call that 'enlightenment won.'
