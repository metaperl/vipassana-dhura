<p class="hd">Using Clear Comprehension: Edmonton Talk #2</p>

<p>
While you are here in this retreat you must move
step-by-step all the time; you must move your hands one at
a time during transitions between postures whether you are
sitting, standing, walking, or going back to sit again.
Except when you go down to breakfast - then you don't
have to move step-by-step exactly. Just move with clear
comprehension. Walk slowly and take the food using clear
comprehension. Clear comprehension means to be aware of,
or be mindful of, whatever you are doing right now.
Don't care about what anyone else is doing. Just
concentrate on what you are doing in the present, but
without breaking your actions into separate movements.
[Note: this instruction is for a group of advanced
meditators. Beginners should still try to maintain the
step-by-step technique as much as possible during a
retreat, even when not formally "meditating."]
</p>
<p>
When you break your actions down into separate moments,
like moving the hands one at a time, or walking
step-by-step, you are using momentary concentration to
support mindfulness. But when you just stand up slowly and
walk slowly [Bhikkhu Sopako demonstrating], that means
that you're using clear comprehension to know the
action. That is nonstop practice, too; you haven't
really given up mindfulness, even though you're not
moving step-by-step. It's just that you're no
longer using momentary concentration to support
mindfulness. When you focus step-by-step, on one object at
a time from moment-to-moment, and you label the objects
with mental notes, you're using momentary
concentration to support mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
But when using clear comprehension you don't need to
label the object. Just be aware of what you are doing in
the present, now. For example: you know that you are
walking. If you are walking too fast you must slow down,
because you are meditators. You are not lay people or
ordinary people walking on the street. They can walk fast,
they can run. But when you are meditators you have to walk
like meditators. You have to walk mindfully or walk using
clear comprehension. You must always have mindfulness
whether sitting, standing, walking, eating, drinking or
doing anything. Continuously. Sometimes you maintain
continuity with the help of momentary concentration.
Sometimes you maintain continuity by using clear
comprehension to support mindfulness. So as long as you
are here you have to keep practicing step-by-step, even if
you are walking in the hall, except when you go to have a
meal or go to the bathroom, for example. At that time you
can give up the step-by-step technique; but do not give up
continuity.
</p>
<p>
An electric light turned on in the daytime doesn't
seem as bright as it does at night. At night the light
seems more clear, more bright, because there's no
light outside. In the daytime, the light is less clear.
But it's still turned on. It's the same for
meditators. When they practice step-by-step, noting each
separate object from moment-to-moment, it's like the
light at night: very clear, very bright. But when they
give up the step-by-step technique and just walk slowly
with mindfulness and clear comprehension, it's like
the electric light in the daytime. But we never turn off
the light because we want to practice continuously,
nonstop. Why do we need to practice nonstop? Because if we
turn off mindfulness, delusion is present. That's why
we don't turn off the light, don't give up
mindfulness at all, even when we go to eat or do something
else; we have to have clear comprehension.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 1: Do you mean that all the time we have to be
mindful and conscious of what we are doing?
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Yeah, that's right. That's
correct.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 1: Twenty-four hours?
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Yes. Twenty-four hours, except when you
sleep. As soon as you wake up you have to continue right
away. That's the meaning of nonstop or continuous
practice. Whenever you have wandering mind, for instance,
just come back to the moment as soon as you're aware
of it. Don't worry about how long it lasted. Forget
it. Just begin again. As long as you know what's going
on, you haven't lost continuity. So you have to
continue all day and all night long for the next several
days except when you're sleeping. Try to keep the
level of mindfulness steady, try to use energy and
concentration to work with mindfulness so as to keep it
continuous. Just notice how long you can continue or how
often you lose mindfulness. How long can you continue with
a body object, a feeling object, a consciousness object,
or a mental (dhamma) object?
</p>


<a name="adding"></a>
<p>
How many drops of water can you put in the cup in a single
day, starting from five a.m.? One drop, two drops, three
drops, all day long until you go to bed. How much water do
you add to the cup? Or, how long do you take a break and
stop adding drops? Just keep adding more and more water,
more and more "moment-to-moment" objects in your
mind. Then you'll be practicing nonstop, continuously.
How much water you will have!
</p>
<p>
The ordinary [unenlightened] mind is the same as dirty
water in a cup. There is a lot of greed, hatred and
delusion. So we try to pour pure water into the cup. One
drop, two drops, three drops until a hundred, a thousand,
a million drops. They dilute the muddy water more and more
until it becomes clear and pure, until we cannot see the
mud at all. The question is, where is the dirty water from
before? Where has it gone? Who can answer? It's like a
swimming pool outside. When it is full of dirty water, the
person who cleans the pool has to understand how to put in
fresh water until the dirt is gone.
</p>
<p>
It's the same thing in the mind. You have to pour
mindfulness in, more and more. You have to put
present-moment objects in the mind every day, all day long
except when you sleep at night. How much your mind becomes
clear and pure. That's the benefit you get. That's
the result from practicing mindfulness; not calmness, not
worldly happiness or psychic power at all, right? [But the
meditator who completes the eight-fold path will get
"supramundane" happiness.] Just a clean mind, a
clear mind [to see ultimate truth.]
</p>
<p>
Like a mirror. When it's too dirty you can't see
your reflection. But then you try to clean it. You clean
more and more until there's no dust left on the
mirror. Then you can see your face very clearly. But where
does that clear reflection come from? It comes from
cleaning the mirror. The mirror by its nature has to show
your reflection. But when there is dust on it, you
can't see it. Yet when you clean the surface, the
reflection shows clearly. It's the same in the mind.
So how can you have a clean or clear mind now? By
practicing continuously. Don't give a chance for
delusion to arise.
</p>
<p>
This morning I saw Peter move like this. [Bhikkhu Sopako
demonstrates stretching his arms without mindfulness.]
That's okay for relaxing or exercising. But when
practicing mindfulness, moving that way gives a chance for
delusion to arise. Instead, when you want to stretch, do
it step-by-step. [Bhikkhu Sopako demonstrates.] Move the
body a little bit. Move [the hands] one by one. Move the
hand down, touch the floor, move one hand at a time. Which
way is of more benefit; to move the way Peter was moving,
the way we do in ordinary life, or to move step-by-step?
To do it this way [the ordinary way] is okay when not
practicing mindfulness. Everyone does that. Most
meditators who have studied with another teacher do that
[i.e., they stretch unmindfully between sitting and
walking practice, which means that they lose continuity.]
They do this just to relax the body by changing position,
for exercise. But if you want to maintain continuity of
mindfulness, you cannot do that, because you'll have
two objects at the same time. Mindfulness does not know
which one to focus on. At that moment you've left a
gap, and delusion can enter.
</p>
<p>
Let's say that your sitting meditation goes very well;
you're able to observe continuously. But when the bell
rings or the time is up you give up mindfulness; you break
the continuity. [I.e., you jump up and stretch or move
carelessly.] But if you want to stretch, like Peter this
morning, do it step-by-step. [Bhikkhu Sopako
demonstrating.] Bend the body [forward] a little bit; move
the hands one by one; then move your head until it touches
the floor. That's the same action but it's very
good because you have mindfulness. That makes it right
action. When you move each hand you are aware of what you
are doing. You have energy and effort, you have
mindfulness, you have continuity and momentary
concentration with the action.
</p>
<p>
How many drops do you get? Moving the body, one; moving
the hand, two; raising up [the hand], three; moving
forward, four; moving down, five; touching, six; moving
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, right? Fourteen times [fourteen separate
movements]. Okay; back to the example. How much water did
you get? Fourteen drops of water [Laughter]. That's a
lot. Better than this [Bhikkhu Sopako stretches his arms
unmindfully]. Nothing, right? [Laughter.]
</p>
<p>
It's the same when Thai people see a Buddha statue.
They bow right away [i.e., unmindfully and too fast].
That's okay for the custom or cultural tradition. But
a meditator should not do that. When you bow like that,
you are bowing with delusion; you are not bowing to the
Buddha. The Buddha means knowledge or wisdom. You have to
bow like this [demonstrating how to bow step-by-step]:
move the head. You don't have to move the head all the
way to the floor. But if you touch the head to the floor
it is the same movement. I will show you now. Move your
body down until your head touches the floor and come back
again, like this. [Demonstrating.] That is how to bow to
the Buddha. "Buddha" means knowledge or wisdom.
So when you move your body, you know [that is, you are
mindful of what you are doing]. When you move your hand,
you know; when you raise it up, you know. That's what
it means to bow to the Buddha [wisdom] rather than bowing
to the material thing called the "Buddha image."
That's not correct.
</p>
<p>
Bowing to the image is bowing from emotion. How can that
be for the Buddha? It just makes people feel happy when
they go to the temple and think about paying respect to
the Buddha. Then they attach with the statue: "Wow,
it's very good. Beautiful." It makes them happy.
But according to ultimate truth or correct practice,
that's not true. The Buddha image is just a statue to
help people think about what he taught. But what did he
teach? The dhamma [here "dhamma" means ultimate
reality]. Where is the dhamma? [Pointing to his chest] in
here. In your own body and mind. The body is rupa
[material phenomena]. Knowing is nama [mind or mental
phenomena]. That's the truth the Buddha taught.
</p>
<p>
You have that in you already. Everybody has it already.
Someone who knows the dhamma can become a Buddha, too. The
Buddha said that whoever wanted to pay respect to him had
to practice the dhamma. The Buddha said, "Whoever
sees the dhamma sees me," even though he passed away
two thousand, five-hundred years ago. We can still see the
Buddha now, by seeing the dhamma. So if we want to pay
respect to him we have to understand what or who the
Buddha is. The Buddha means knowledge [of ultimate
reality]. What does the Buddha know? What does knowledge
or wisdom know? Wisdom knows the dhamma. What is the
dhamma? Rupa and nama. Rupa and nama are the truth or the
dhamma.
</p>
<p>
And those who develop wisdom by practicing vipassana are
called the "sangha." The sangha means [the order
of enlightened beings]: sotapanna [the stream-winner],
sakadagami [the once-returner], anagami [the
non-returner], and arahant [the holy one]. Those are the
four levels of the sangha. The real sangha does not refer
to the monks who shave their heads, wear yellow robes and
take 227 precepts. The organization of monks is the
conventional sangha. But the sangha according to the
triple gem [the Buddha, the dhamma and the sangha] means
the group of beings who have attained enlightenment. It
doesn't matter if they are monks and nuns or lay
people. That is the real sangha.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 1: So you don't mean the monks that you see
around in Thailand with the yellow robe - you don't
mean that?
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: No. I don't mean that. That is the
ordinary sangha of monks that performs ceremonies
according to the Buddhist tradition. They can ordain
others or do things to serve the people. But if you want
to take refuge you have to understand the higher meaning.
You have to understand what is really meant by the Buddha,
the dhamma, and the sangha. If you understand, then you
have taken refuge already. You do not need to go to a
temple or ask a monk to do a ceremony so that you can
become a Buddhist. It doesn't matter.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't matter if you are Buddhist or not, if you
have knowledge to understand the truth. Anyone who
eliminates ignorance and the other defilements can become
enlightened, too. That person can become a "Noble
One" the same as a Buddhist. The dhamma does not
belong to the Buddha or Buddhism exclusively. It is always
in the world. Right now, the truth is here in you and me.
Everybody has rupa and nama. Rupa and nama are the truth.
They are the path. And everyone can practice the
eight-fold path, the right path. [The eight-fold path
consists of: right effort, right mindfulness, right
concentration, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right view and right thought.] How can you
practice the eight-fold path right now? Make the effort to
move your hand [as in the hand-motions exercise. See
"How to Meditate"]. That's right effort. Use
mindfulness to focus on moving. Focus on moving, not the
hand itself. As you raise the hand up, keep using
mindfulness to focus continuously. You will have right
effort, right mindfulness and right concentration when you
move the hand up or down, when you touch or move, nonstop.
</p>
<p>
How many steps? Like I said before about the fourteen or
fifteen moments of movement [with stretching]. . . every
time that you move you have right effort, right
mindfulness and right concentration. When you maintain
step-by-step mindfulness during transitions between
postures, when you continue to observe from
moment-to-moment, one object at a time, that is right
action. When you keep silent, that's right speech.
When you eat or drink mindfully, that's right
livelihood. So you can complete six factors of the
eight-fold path by observing nama and rupa right now.
Sitting is rupa; knowing is nama. You are making right
effort when you focus on sitting, or focus on
rising-falling at the stomach.
</p>
<p>
[Regarding the rising-falling exercise] Concentrate here,
about two inches over the navel. You can focus on this
point, on the center of the body, when you breathe in and
out. It doesn't matter exactly where you feel rising
and falling. But just focus on a point. Like when you take
a picture with a camera, you focus on one spot [that is,
you don't have to bring each part of the picture into
focus individually]. You focus on one point so that, if
there are two images, they become one. How can you focus
so that the picture is sharp, so that the double image
becomes one? If you can do that you will have a good
picture.
</p>
<p>
When you focus correctly, from moment-to-moment, you will
have a clear picture in your mind. Rupa and nama will be
very clear. Or, like I said before, when you pour pure
water into the cup you can eliminate the dirty water more
and more. That's the benefit you get all the time, you
see? So you have to understand the truth and the meaning
of what we are doing. You have to understand the reason.
Don't just do it from faith or confidence; that's
not correct.
</p>
<p>
Confidence and wisdom have to work together. For example,
you have to understand the purpose of focusing on sitting
[referring to the meditation on the sitting posture]. What
is the meaning of "sitting"? What is it that is
sitting? What is it that knows sitting is happening? You
have to find out the truth about the sitting object.
Because most people have attachment and they think,
"I am sitting." But what or where is the
"I" in sitting? Is it the hair or head or body
or hand or leg? Where is the "I"? Or, where is
"sitting"? You cannot find it. [Pointing to
parts of his body] this is the head, not sitting. This is
the hand, not sitting. This is the leg, not sitting. This
is the hip, not sitting. Where is sitting, Cathy?
</p>
<p>
Cathy: You focus on a point of sitting. Rupa is sitting.
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Yes. Who knows sitting?
</p>
<p>
Cathy: I can't remember what you said.
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Is it correct to say, "I know
sitting"?
</p>
<p>
Cathy: Nama knows sitting.
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Nama knows; that's correct. If you
answer, "I know sitting," that's not
correct. But you are correct; you are right. You
understand already that the truth is, "nama knows
sitting," not, "I am sitting." Also, it is
not the body that is sitting. Sitting is not [identical
to] the body. The body is not the same thing as
"sitting." Or, when you move the hand up,
movement is not the hand. The hand and the movement are
two different things.
</p>
<p>
This morning I mentioned that you have to separate in
order to understand the truth. If you are focusing on the
hand, you cannot see arising and passing away or
impermanence, suffering and non-self. The hand is ego or
self; it is [relatively] permanent, right? The hand does
not experience suffering or unsatisfactoriness. [When we
have pain "in the hand," for example, the
painful feeling is actually a mental phenomena. Matter
itself cannot feel or experience.] And the hand is self.
["Hand" is a concept, a conventional idea that
does not actually exist objectively. What exists
objectively are just the material elements, earth, air,
water and fire that arise and pass away very quickly. But
when we talk about them as a "hand" we perceive
these elements as relatively permanent and assume them to
belong to a person, an individual, a self. But this
assumed self doesn't exist in ultimate terms.]
</p>
<p>
A tree, for example, is permanent. Although it grows and
eventually dies, it doesn't change position from hour
to hour. But the tree's shadow moves every minute
because the sun moves. When we look at the tree we cannot
see any movement or change. But when looking at the
shadow, in one hour we can see that it has moved from here
to there; we know that it has been moving a little bit all
the time. The shadow never stays in the same place; it
always has to move.
</p>
<p>
It is similar to the mind. [In this analogy, the mind is
the sun, the body the tree, and bodily movement, the
tree's shadow.] For instance, when we raise the hand
up, we can see the movement arise and pass away. We can
see the knowing of the movement arise and pass away, too.
That's correct. That movement comes from the mind. The
mind is never permanent. [A movement of the arm or leg, of
course, doesn't last as long as the physical body
itself. The motion lasts only one moment; we can see it
begin and end right now, whereas the physical body can
persist for 80 or more years. So the motion is like the
shadow because we can see it change in the present. We can
see impermanence in it. And the body moves because the
mind makes it move, just as the shadow is
"produced" by sunlight. The motion and the
shadow are impermanent. But the physical body, for all
practical purposes, is permanent. Like the tree, we cannot
perceive its changes. In vipassana we want to see the
truth of impermanence. For that reason motion, rather than
the physical body per se, is the correct object of
mindfulness.]
</p>
<p>
When the mind no longer orders the hand to move, the hand
cannot move. The hand must stop. When the body is without
nama or consciousness, it cannot move. It is like a chair;
it cannot move by itself. It is like a dead body. So we
should understand that the movement of the hand comes from
nama, comes from consciousness.
</p>
<p>
The mind, with the help of the air element, can make the
body light so that it can move. When the body moves or
changes into another posture, that's the air element.
So where do the four postures come from? They come from
the mind. When the mind wants the body to stand up, it
orders it to move. When the mind wants to walk, it makes
the legs light, not heavy, so that it's easy to walk.
Usually, when the mind does not want to move it can make
the body very heavy, to the point that it can hardly be
moved at all. So there are three things [involved in the
act of bodily motion]:</p>
<p>1) Consciousness.<br>
2) the air element.<br>
3) Motion.</p>
<p>Motion and the air element are rupa. Consciousness,
awareness of the movement or posture, is nama. For
example, right now my mind wants to sit. It is making the
body sit, sit, sit.
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="correct"></a>

<p class="hd">Correct Object of Mindfulness</p>

<p>
The water element makes the body sink. When you lie down,
the water element is the leader, because a stream of water
always flows downward. When you stand up, the fire element
is in charge. Fire makes the body go up since fire always
burns upwards, never downwards. When you walk [or
otherwise move] the air element is in charge. [And when
you sit, the earth element dominates.] They take turns
being in charge. That's one meaning of change in the
elements or in rupa. Rupa and nama, the mind that orders
the body to move, have to work together. When nama and
rupa make contact in the present moment, that is the
correct object of mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
If you are just observing the body, that's not the
correct object of mindfulness. That's an object of
concentration. If you only have nama, that's not a
correct object of mindfulness, either. You have to observe
rupa and nama as they come together in the present moment,
right now. That's the correct object of mindfulness. A
student asked about this yesterday in the car. But
it's very hard to observe correctly, to observe the
present moment exactly. For instance, right now: we are
sitting here now. But while sitting here you might be
thinking, "I am sitting here now." Okay; you are
staying in the present time. But that is not the same as
being in the present moment exactly. It is very hard to
see it correctly, to bring nama and rupa together. It is
very hard to see the exact moment of rupa and nama. [In
vipassana, "being in the present moment" has a
specific meaning, i.e.: to be clearly aware of one nama
and one object as they come into contact. If one sees this
clearly, there will be no sense of "I,"
"myself," or "my body."] A person
might practice all day long and only see it one time. That
is very special. But someone else will not see it until
after two or three days of practicing. For others it might
take a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, two months,
seven months. Others might practice [continuously] for
seven years until they see the present moment exactly,
correctly, even once.
</p>
<p>
If you see the present moment of rupa and nama even once,
that makes your life special. That is better than living a
hundred years. [A person who sees this is called
"jhula-sota," meaning a "junior"
sotapanna. ("Sotapanna" refers to someone who
has reached the first level of enlightenment.) A
jhula-sota cannot be reborn in the lower realms for three
subsequent lifetimes. His or her mind is ripe to reach the
first level of enlightenment.] In the Dhammapada it says
that someone who lives for a hundred years has not gained
anything special. But the person who practices insight
meditation and can clearly see, for one moment, the truth
of rupa and nama arising and passing away, even if he dies
then and there, is far better off than the person who
lives a hundred years and doesn't see it. Because
those who can see rupa and nama have made their minds
clear and clean. They have eliminated doubt. That's
important.
</p>
<p>
For example: the Empire State Building in New York. Some
people read about it but never actually see it. Even when
they know everything about it from reading, they still
have doubts about what it's like. Then there are those
who are not interested in the story of the building. But
when they go to New York they see the building, go up to
the 98th floor and take in the view of the city. They no
longer have any doubt about what that building is like.
They don't need to read about it, because they have
seen it firsthand.
</p>
<p>
It's the same thing; when you see rupa and nama one
time, even if you die, it's better than not seeing it
and living for a hundred years. Just living for a hundred
years [without knowledge of ultimate truth] isn't
special at all because, what is happening during that
time? You wake up in the morning, eat, go to work, come
home, shop, take a shower, eat again, and go to bed. Then
you wake up and it starts all over again. Every day you
repeat the same thing. There's nothing new, right? You
never know about rupa and nama.
</p>
<p>
But you have come here for five days. From the moment you
wake up you have mindfulness all the time, except when
you're sleeping. Sometimes mindfulness is lost a
little bit but then you continue again right away. Five
days here is better than staying at home. You can keep the
benefit of this retreat in your mind the rest of your
life. You will feel happy with the experience, happy with
having come to this retreat. Here, since you have
mindfulness all day long, you're adding pure water to
the cup all the time; you have already benefited from what
you have done. That's why staying here is very special
for your life.
</p>
<p>
In daily life there is delusion and ignorance in the mind
all the time, twenty-four hours. But here, except when you
are sleeping for five or six hours, and the few times that
you "lose the moment," you are mindful all day
long. So you only have delusion for about eight hours, and
mindfulness for fourteen or sixteen hours. How special
that is, how different from ordinary life, from what
you'd be doing if you had not come here. Do you see
the difference between staying here and developing
mindfulness, and staying at home? Are they different or
not? Do you see the difference? Peg?
</p>
<p>
Peg: Well, it depends on what one does at home.
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Okay. What do you do at home?
</p>
<p>
Peg: Well, if you're on retreat at home, of course you
can maintain your mindfulness there, but in day-to-day
life, as you were saying. . .
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Okay, I agree with that. If you practice
insight meditation at home, it's no different from
being here. But how long do you have time to practice
mindfulness at home? That's the difference. At home
you might not have a long period of time like this. Just
one or two hours. But here you have almost the whole day
until bedtime. We have someone to cook for you and a staff
to take care of things. You are very lucky to be
practicing rather than doing something else.
</p>
<p>
Even though you had to spend money for room and board and
transportation, it's just a little bit. But the
benefit is great. For example, you might spend two or
three dollars to buy a box of laundry soap, right? From
that one box you can wash a lot of clothes. You get a lot
for your money. Same thing: you spend a little money to
come here and buy some dhamma soap to clean your mind.
[Laughter.] You will be happy from having cleaned your
mind, all right? The benefit will continue for your whole
life and even into next. Even though you've only spent
a little bit to come here, the benefit will last beyond
this life, even until you reach nibbana. You are adding
paramita, adding background at this retreat, and the
benefit will continue into the future.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 2: Is there always water going into the glass?
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Oh, sure. But just be careful about the
dirty water.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 2: Is it always the same amount?
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Yes. Because everything in the world
should balance. In everyday life either greed, hatred or
delusion always arises whenever you see, hear, smell,
taste, touch, think, stand, walk, and so on. When you like
something, desire arises. When you don't like
something, hatred arises. [Although liking and disliking
are milder states than greed and hatred, the latter two
are the mental factors from which liking and disliking
spring. Greed and hatred are always present in the
unenlightened mind, lying dormant until triggered by an
appropriate object.] When you feel so-so, when you look at
a wall, for example, and feel neither liking nor
disliking, delusion arises. Delusion arises because you
don't know what you are seeing [i.e., you don't
perceive the object in ultimate terms, as merely nama or
rupa. You still perceive it as a named, conventional
thing.] You don't know that the color or image is
rupa, and that seeing is nama [the act of seeing is
carried out by nama]. Whenever you don't know rupa and
nama you have delusion or ignorance. When you are sitting,
you don't know that sitting is rupa, and that the
agent that knows sitting is nama. You just think,
"I'm sitting here." That's delusion.
[It's delusion because one has the wrong view that
it's a self or an "I" that is sitting.]
</p>
<p>
If you feel, "I like this chair," that means
that desire has arisen. Or if you think, "I don't
like this chair. I don't want to sit here," that
means that hatred has arisen. You are never without one of
these three defilements. If the object is good, desire
arises; if the object is bad, hatred arises; if the object
is neutral, delusion arises, twenty-four hours a day.
</p>
<p>
When you're asleep delusion is always present, not
mindfulness. As soon as you wake up, if you hear something
good, desire arises; if you hear something bad, hatred
arises; if you hear something so-so, delusion arises. But
from the time of your birth until now, how often have you
had a chance to practice mindfulness? This retreat is only
five days long. You will only have mindfulness for five
days, compared to the many years of having defilements all
day long. That's why you have to keep going and set up
mindfulness, concentration and wisdom to balance the
defilements first. When you balance them [i.e., when
mindfulness is as strong as greed, hatred and delusion]
then you can add more.
</p>
<p>
Mindfulness will go up after that. [First you develop
mindfulness until it's equal to the three defilements;
after that, when it becomes stronger than greed, hatred
and delusion, you'll be able to eliminate those
factors.]
</p>
<p>
Take the same example again. Say that I have Coca-Cola in
this glass. I take a sip; it tastes strong and sweet, so I
add more and more pure water to the glass. When it is
balanced, when it is half Coke and half water, I taste it
again. Everything is less; the sweet taste is not as
strong, even though it is still there. But when I keep
adding water, until there is more water than Coke, I
cannot taste the Coke anymore. It tastes almost like pure
water. The color is clear, too. The question is, where has
the Coke gone? Where can it go to? It is still there; but
when you have more water in proportion, you cannot taste
or see the Coke anymore.
</p>
<p>
It's the same thing: when we add mindfulness,
awareness, wisdom, and concentration to the mind more and
more, until we have more of these factors than greed,
hatred and delusion, the mind becomes clear. But right now
the pure water and the Coke are not balanced, which makes
it very hard to continue. [Now there is still more Coke
than water.] But when you keep practicing until they are
balanced you will feel, "Oh, now it is easy to
practice meditation. Now I feel relaxed and I can keep
going for a long time."
</p>
<p>
After they are balanced you can continue to add more and
more water, diluting the defilements even more. Right now
the defilements are high and mindfulness is low. You need
to develop mindfulness until it is balanced with the
defilements first; after that it can fight with them and
win. If you continue practicing after they are balanced,
then mindfulness will go up higher than the defilements.
Mindfulness will get higher and higher, the defilements,
lower and lower.
</p>
<p>
That's the nature of the truth; that is what Lord
Buddha taught. It is not something special; it's just
the truth. That truth is always in the world. But it
doesn't mean that you should expect to get something
special or become happy from meditating. No. [I.e., you
should not take up vipassana expecting to have exciting or
blissful experiences. But a superior kind of happiness
will arise from giving up attachments.] Meditation is just
for balancing the unwholesome and wholesome factors in
your mind. You have to think about which one is higher.
What do you want to ask?
</p>
<p>
Meditator 3: Well, I think I've worked it out. My
question was, what is the difference between neutral and
equanimity and balance.
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: What is the difference, right? The object
is different. The object of neutrality is ordinary truth.
The object of equanimity, in insight meditation, is
ultimate truth.
</p>
<p>
When we feel neutral toward something [such as a wall], we
are perceiving a conventional truth object. When
equanimity arises from tranquility practice [concentration
meditation], the object is also an ordinary truth object.
But in that case the mind stays on a single object.
</p>
<p>
But the equanimity in insight meditation is different; in
that case we have an ultimate truth object, and there is
no attachment to it. Because we can see the momentary
nature of phenomena, because we can see that all namas and
rupas arise and pass away equally, we realize that they
are all impermanent, or unsatisfactory, or lacking in
self, and because of that we feel equanimity toward them.
So neutrality and equanimity differ in that they have
different objects.
</p>
<p>
For example, when you concentrate on the Buddha statue and
close the eyes and repeat the word "Buddho, Buddho,
Buddho," over and over, you develop more and more
concentration with the object. Tranquility becomes deeper
and deeper until you enter a trance, from the first jhana
to the fifth jhana. [Bhikkhu Sopako is referring to the
meditation practice of repeating the Buddha's name.
The meditation object in this and other concentration
techniques is an object of conventional reality. The
"jhanas" refer to various levels of trance
induced by strong concentration.] On the other hand, you
could look at the Buddha statue without attaching to its
conventional meaning, and without holding the wrong view
that it is a self or a material eye that sees. You could
just observe, "seeing, seeing, seeing," [the act
of seeing], and understand the truth that the thing you
are looking at is just color. Color is rupa. There is just
nama seeing rupa. There is nothing going on except nama
seeing rupa. There is no me or you; there is no Buddha
statue.
</p>
<p>
So give up the name of the object, give up ordinary truth.
Then you just have ultimate truth. Then you can answer the
question, "What is seeing?" or, "What is it
that sees?" Then you understand that there is just
color and [the act of] knowing color. When you continue
observing "seeing, seeing, seeing" in the
present moment, every moment, until you can see one moment
arise and pass away, until you can see impermanence,
unsatisfactoriness and non-self, then you can eliminate
attachment, attachment to [the wrong view of] permanence;
or you can dilute liking and disliking for the object more
and more until you have correct understanding of the
truth. That's the meaning of "insight."
</p>
<p>
At first we label objects [with mental notes] in order to
develop momentary concentration. It is concentration, but
not really tranquility. [I.e., this is "concentration
in insight," concentration mixed with mindfulness, as
opposed to the pure concentration of the trance-states.]
At first you try to make your concentration strong enough
to perceive objects in a moment-to-moment fashion, one by
one; but after that you give up the label. You just do it.
You just let mindfulness focus in the present. That's
correct vipassana, all right?
</p>
<p>
Meditator 4: I have a question. When you say,
"Seeing, seeing, seeing," isn't that being
neutral? And if it is, how is that delusion? I thought
that was. . . if you are being neutral you're not
attached to it, you don't love it and you don't
hate it, it's just there. So I don't understand
how you said, "If you're neutral that's
delusion." I'm confused here.
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: If you see [if you think you are seeing] a
Buddha statue, that's neutrality; that's ordinary
truth. When you don't know about ultimate truth, when
you do not realize that it is impossible to see a Buddha
statue, that's delusion. Even if you are aware of,
"seeing, seeing," when you don't know that
we can only see color, and that it is not actually the
physical eye that sees, but consciousness; when you do not
know that consciousness only sees color, not a Buddha
statue, that means that you have delusion. If you cannot
separate ordinary truth from ultimate truth, and focus on
ultimate truth only, you will have delusion. So the
correct path is to ignore the name of the thing you are
seeing or hearing [or smelling, tasting, knowing, and so
forth] and focus only on ultimate truth. But if you just
keep observing ordinary truth, delusion will be present.
</p>
<p>
The practice of tranquility meditation uses ordinary or
conventional truth objects. It is for developing
concentration, not wisdom. Sometimes a name is used to
develop concentration, as in mantra practice. [A mantra is
a special word or phrase that is repeated, like the word
"Buddho."] You memorize it and say it again and
again. Even the practice of focusing on the hair, skin,
nails and so on makes concentration arise, too. [Bhikkhu
Sopako is referring to the practice of meditating on the
"thirty-two parts" of the body. The body-parts
are conventional-, not ultimate-truth objects, so they are
suited for developing concentration, not insight.]
Anything else?
</p>
<p>
Meditator 4: Thank you. I'm still deluded but I
understand better now.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 3: If we are so non-mindful so much of the time,
how do we ever get the glass filled up with pure water?
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Oh, that's a good question too. If you
understand precisely what is correct, if you can follow
the correct path, it is easy to fill up the glass; maybe
you can do it in just one day or one hour. But usually
meditators do not understand in a precise way; not having
right understanding, they cannot follow the right path.
That means that they go quite slowly. They have farther to
go [because they can't find the direct route]. It
takes them longer because they still have doubt in their
minds.
</p>
<p>
Or they practice with desire; they want to get something
in return, want to have something. That's why it's
very hard to add drops. Even when they add a drop, it
isn't pure water. That's why I always try to make
sure that you understand correctly, that you have enough
right understanding for me to give instructions so that
you can keep going. If you do not have correct
understanding, then, even if I give instructions, you will
not be successful. You'll only get concentration.
Everybody feels calm or happy at times during sitting
meditation. But you are satisfied with this. You are happy
when you get a little bit only. But that has no benefit at
all. [Meditators aim too low; they are satisfied with the
calmness of concentration, not true insight. But that
mundane peace is temporary and doesn't advance one
toward nibbana, permanent freedom from suffering.]
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="realbenefit"></a>

<p class="hd">The Real Benefit</p>

<p>
Real 'benefit' means: seeing nama-rupa arise
and pass away, even for one moment. Like I said before: if
you see that one time, you are better off than someone who
lives for a hundred years but doesn't see it.
</p>
<p>
Because seeing this is not for everyone. It can only be
seen by those who have paramita or background enough.
[Here "background" refers to an aptitude for
understanding, arising from previous wholesome actions.
Although few people have this "merit," all
beings are capable of developing background if they so
choose.] Even to hear the dhamma that I am explaining now
is not easy. Only a few people can understand it. Only a
few people are interested to come and listen. If you
compare the people here now with the population of
Edmonton - how many million are there? Who knows?
</p>
<p>
Meditator 5: Six-hundred thousand [people in Edmonton].
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Six-hundred thousand, right? But here
there are just twenty-one people. The sutras compare the
number of wise people in the world to the horns of a cow -
there are only two horns. But the number of foolish people
are compared to the number of hairs on a cow. Too many to
count, right? But the horns are easy to see. Everybody
knows that there are only two. But the hairs on a cow are
very hard to count. It would take too long.
</p>
<p>
So the teachings are not very hard to understand if
someone has knowledge, or background, or paramita to
understand them. Then it is easy. That's why I am
happy to teach even a few people. I am happy to teach the
dhamma because I know that the dhamma is not for everyone.
It belongs to someone who has experience or good kamma
[karma, intentional action] from the past. People have to
have background from before, perhaps from their last life,
in order to understand these teachings. Even if you
don't believe about past or future incarnations, it
doesn't matter. But those who understand this dhamma
already have background.
</p>
<p>
All of you who have come here have background or paramita
enough. If you didn't have paramita, you would not
have had the confidence and energy to spend time to come
here. But most people are not interested; that's
because they don't have background. That's why I
keep talking; because I know that everyone here has enough
background to understand. [The mere fact of being
interested in vipassana can be an indication of
"background."]
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="truth"></a>

<p class="hd">Truth Does Not Change</p>

<p>
The truth does not change. Lord Buddha said that he did
not teach the impossible. He did not teach something that
wasn't the truth. He taught what was possible to
reach; he taught the dhamma, the truth, to the world. But
the dhamma does not belong to Lord Buddha. It belongs to
the universe. Rupa and nama are still here. The eight-fold
path is still here. Enlightenment is still possible. If
you continue on the path you can become enlightened
anytime, anywhere. It doesn't matter whether it's
the time of the Buddha, or now, or the future. If people
understand the correct path, they can keep going; they can
be free from suffering. They can reach enlightenment,
nibbana, when they reach the end of the path.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 3: What you're saying is that truth is not
Buddhism, but Buddhism is truth.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 5: Truth doesn't belong to Buddhism.
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: No, it does not belong to Buddhism. But
Lord Buddha knew the dhamma; that's why he could teach
the truth. Only Lord Buddha could get enlightened by
himself. [It's said that only the Buddhas
(Samma-Sambuddhas and Pacceka-Buddhas) can realize the
Four Noble Truths independently, without having heard them
from anyone.]
</p>
<p>
Why could he be enlightened by himself? Because he had
learned a lot; he had many, many teachers. The teachers
told him that he was enlightened already, that he had
eliminated the defilements already. But he didn't
believe that. He felt, "Even when the teachers
approve my enlightenment, I still have confusion and doubt
in my mind. How can I be enlightened already?" But
when he looked for another teacher he couldn't find
one. He had studied and practiced with all the great
teachers already. That's why he tried to practice by
himself.
</p>
<p>
Before that he had tried mortification practices such as
going without food. But then he knew that starving himself
was not the correct path, so he tried to follow the Middle
Way [between the two extremes of self-indulgence and
self-mortification]. He made a strong resolution to find
enlightenment by himself, to find the truth. He already
had concentration enough to enter a trance. When he began
to develop mindfulness he thought about what the happiness
from the trance state was. When a person achieves the
trance level [jhana] he feels happiness or joy with the
object. When he sits, he makes that happiness the object
of his meditation. He brings nama to know the object.
Usually those who reach the trance level attach with the
object. They feel good; they are able to sit for a long
time.
</p>
<p>
But Lord Buddha pulled his mind back from the object. He
focused on nama [the knowing mind itself] rather than on
the object. Because the object of concentration is
permanent. It doesn't change. It is always steady. The
Lord Buddha was very smart; he withdrew his mind from the
object and focused his mindfulness on nama instead. When
his mind no longer attached with the object, he was able
to look at the mind. So he tried to look at his mind, to
look at the nama that knows the object.
</p>
<p>
When he focused on nama he was surprised because he saw
that nama was never permanent, never steady. He could see
the individual moments of nama [as they arose and passed
away]. As he kept observing nama, he lost interest in the
object. He realized that when the mind did not attach with
the object, there was, in effect, nothing there. There was
no happiness from the trance state anymore. The object had
disappeared.
</p>
<p>
When we hear a sound now, whether it's my voice as I
talk or a sound from outside, we can know that sound
vibrations are present. When you turn on the radio in your
room, you can hear a song or the news. But when you
don't hear anything, that means that, for you, there
is effectively no sound in the world.
</p>
<p>
It's the same thing; when the Buddha did not attach
with the object from the trance state, the trance became
empty; there was no object there. Instead, he just worked
with [observed] nama from moment-to-moment, until he
realized that nama was not permanent. Nama couldn't
stay long; it just arose and then passed away immediately.
He knew that it was only his previous attachment with the
object of jhana that had caused the feeling of happiness.
[The Buddha withdrew his mindfulness from the
trance-object and observed the knowing mind itself. But
then he saw that consciousness was intermittent; it arose
and died out in an instant. That impermanence meant that
consciousness was unstable and unsatisfactory; it could
never be a reliable source of happiness. Yet by seeing
this fact he gained the greater happiness of nibbana.]
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="impermanence"></a>

<p class="hd">Impermanence, Unsatisfactoriness, Non-Self</p>

<p>
When people see nama from moment-to-moment they never feel
happy. On the contrary, they must see unsatisfactoriness,
or one of the other three characteristics, more and more.
[The three characteristics of all phenomena are:
impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness or suffering
(dukkha), and non-self (anatta).]
</p>
<p>
Someone who has previously attained a trance state will
see suffering more than impermanence or non-self.
[Meditators will see the characteristic most opposed to
their own wrong views. Those who have attained a trance
believe strongly that nama and rupa can provide happiness;
so to them, unsatisfactoriness is more striking than
impermanence or non-self.]
</p>
<p>
The Buddha also had panna paramita [the perfection of
wisdom], so he could see non-self clearly, too. Ordinary
meditators can only see one of the three characteristics.
But the Lord Buddha could see all three. Those who have
practiced generosity or morality in the past can see
impermanence. Those who have practiced forbearance
[khanti], loving-kindness [metta], or have developed
strong concentration, for example, can see
unsatisfactoriness more. Those who have developed wisdom
or strong resolve [adhitthana] can see non-self. But since
the Buddha had developed all ten perfections he could see
all three characteristics. That's special. There is
only one truth, but it has three characteristics. The
Buddha could see all of them. But disciples or meditators
can only see one.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 5: So he [the Buddha] looked at nama and he saw
that nama continued to fluctuate; and because he saw the
fluctuation and lack of substance he could see that it
wasn't satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 3: Which is why, when we are moving our hand, we
are not to think of the hand, just the movement?
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Yes. That's the way the Lord Buddha
developed insight. Before, he attached with the object
just as we attach with the hand now. If we try to move but
still attach to the hand we cannot see motion [as an
object by itself]. Because the hand is permanent. [To our
perception a chair is motionless, even though we've
learned that, according to physicists, it is comprised of
sub-atomic particles in constant motion. On that level,
the "chair" isn't stable at all. Likewise,
rupa and nama are constantly moving and changing, arising
and vanishing. But since we can't yet perceive this
micro-level, rather than blips of mind and matter arising
and exploding very quickly, we perceive permanent
conceptual things called "hand,"
"foot," "chair," and so on. But that
permanence is only a misperception.]
</p>
<p>
Just as when we concentrate on a tree; we cannot see it
changing because the tree is permanent. [The tree stays in
the same place in the ground; it doesn't change
position.] But when we observe the tree's shadow we
can see that it moves a little bit all the time. It's
the same thing: when we try to observe movement, we can
see it arise and pass away, because it comes from the
mind, just like the moving shadow comes from the sun.
Since the shadow is cast by a moving object, it, too, has
to move. So you have to pay attention to nama. The
hindrances or defilements are in the mind, not the body,
you see? We are practicing to eliminate hindrances,
defilements or unwholesome states of mind. So we have to
focus on nama.
</p>
<p>
Say that there is a fire in this building. If we send the
fire department to another building, how can we be
successful? How can we put out the fire here? It's the
same thing: if we put knowledge or wisdom in the wrong
place, or send it in the wrong direction, we cannot be
successful. That's the secret.
</p>
<p>
Meditator 5: So if you put your attention to the object
you're sending the fire department to the wrong
building.
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Yes. You have to make sure which building
the fire is in. Where does the fire burn? Which building
do you need to pour water on? You have to think about
that. So try to pay attention to nama more than rupa. The
truth of arising and passing away must be seen in nama, in
consciousness.
</p>
<p>
If we were without consciousness we couldn't perceive
sound vibrations, for example. But when we are hearing we
can verify that there are sound waves present. When we are
not seeing anything, how can we know that there is a
visual object or color there? When we don't smell
anything, we cannot know if there is a fragrance present.
It's just empty [of an object.] It is only when nama
is present to receive an object that we can verify that an
object exists. So we have to think about what the truth is
or how we can see it. We have to pay attention to see nama
[the mind] more than the object. Only two things are the
truth; one thing stays to be known; another thing is
actively knowing it. The thing that stays to be known is
rupa [here "rupa" simply means, "an object
of awareness," which can be either material or
mental.] The thing that knows the object is nama. Only
nama and rupa exist right now. Only they are the truth.
