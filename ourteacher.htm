<h2>Our Teacher</h2>

<img class="left" src="achan.jpg" alt="Achan Sobin Namto"> 

<p>One of the first teachers at the Insight Meditation  Society in Barre, Bhikkhu Sopako Bodhi (Achan Sobin Namto)  was born in Wangplado, Thailand, in 1932. While still  young he moved to Bangkok to ordain as a monk and study  the Buddhist teachings.</p>

<p>At just nineteen he undertook a seven-month intensive  meditation retreat with the great vipassana master Chao  Khun Bhavanapirama Thera, who introduced him to a  meticulous step-by-step method for developing mindfulness.</p>

<p>For some time afterward he lived as a solitary forest monk  confronting all the dangers of the Asian jungle, including  tigers and poisonous snakes.</p>

<p>In Thailand and Burma, Ven. Sopako studied vipassana with  the most renowned teachers of the age, including Mahasi  Sayadaw. At just twenty-four, Ven. Sopako himself became a  recognized vipassana and abhidhamma teacher  (&quot;abhidhamma&quot; means Buddhist metaphysics). He  taught for many years at the famous Section Five of Wat  Maha Dhatu monastery in Bangkok, as well as in many other  temples. He later established and ran a meditation center  in southern Thailand.</p>

<p>In 1972, he became Abbot of the first Thai Buddhist Temple  ever built in the United States, in North Hollywood,  California. Four years later he organized the founding of  Wat Buddhawararam of Denver, a Buddhist temple that he  envisioned would promote the spread of insight meditation.</p>
   
<p>Among many commendations, Ven. Sopako has been recognized  by the Mayor of Los Angeles and the King of Thailand for  his work in spreading the teachings of Buddhism to the  west.</p>
   
<p>Ven. Sopako now resides in his home village of Wangplado, Thailand, where he is working to build a meditation center and a stupa to house the relics of the Buddha. The stupa, or "pagoda," will replicate the famous Buddhist shrine in Bodhgaya, India, which marks the place of the Buddha's enlightenment.</p>
   
<p>Ven. Sopako&#39;s students and friends remark on his  warmth, compassion and humor, but also his uncompromising  adherence to the original teachings of the Buddha. He is  regarded by many as one of the world&#39;s leading  authorities on vipassana meditation and abhidhamma. His  tireless efforts to share this knowledge have benefited  the world beyond measure.</p>
