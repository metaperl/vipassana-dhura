# The Vipassana Dhura website offers copious resources on the theory
of Theravada Buddhism as well as the practice of the Mahasi Sayadaw
method of meditation.


The [Vipassana Dhura Website](https://metaperl.github.io/vipassana-dhura)
is a fairly complete guide to the Mahasi Sayadaw approach to meditation.
It contains books, videos, articles as well as links to other 
information-packed
sites.

The Vipassana Dhura Meditation Society was primarily run by 
[the late Cynthia Thatcher](http://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/in-memoriam/obituaries/june2014/cynthia-thatcher-1988.html) 
who authored the book 
["Just Seeing"](https://metaperl.github.io/vipassana-dhura/PDF/bp505s_Thatcher_Just-Seeing.pdf). I was pleased to
[work with her](http://static.livingcosmos.org/metaphysics/dhamma.txt) when
she ran the Dhamma Friend training program.

The web presence of the society is handled by these people:
* Bill Flanagan runs [the original site](http://www.vipassanadhura.com/)
* Terrence Brannon operates a [derivative of the site](https://metaperl.github.io/vipassana-dhura)
whose [contents are completely open-source]. My version of the site is done
for no pay. Bill, however, accepted cookies mailed from 
Margarita (Cynthia's mother) as payment
for his version of the website :)
