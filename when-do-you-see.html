<h2>When Do You See?</h2>

<div id="byline">
<span class="subtitle">A Dhamma Talk and Interview with Students</span><br>
By Ven. Sopako Bodhi Bhikkhu<br />
<span class="subtitle">Calgary Talk #1</span></div>

<p>
This talk contains references to specific meditation
exercises. See <a href="howto.htm">How to Meditate</a> for
a detailed explanation of the techniques. The Pali word
'nama' means mind or mental phenomena. The word
'rupa' means material phenomena. It can also mean
something known by the mind, as opposed to the mind
itself.
</p>
<p>
Recorded in Calgary, Canada, 1988. <em>The comments in
brackets are the editor's</em>.
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<p>
In insight meditation, or vipassana, you have to observe a
complete object in the present moment. What do I mean by,
"complete in the present moment right now"? Take
the example of seeing. Don't pay attention to the name
of the object you're looking at. Give up the name.
Just see color.
</p>
<p>
Now, where do you see it? When do you see it? When color
makes contact with the eye - that's when you see. At
that moment. [Striking a match] Like this match. It
contacts the strip on the box, right? The strip is like
the eye. The match is like a visible form coming to make
contact. Then fire appears. Where does it come from? Is it
in the match or in the strip? We can't tell. But when
they come into contact, fire arises.
</p>
<p>
Same thing: when a visible form contacts the eye, the
consciousness of seeing happens at that time, at that
moment. Why do we see at that moment? Because several
conditions come together. One, color or visible form. Two,
a functioning eye. We have good eyesight. We're not
blind. Three, light. If it's dark we can't see,
even if we have good eyesight. And four, there is
consciousness to see.
</p>
<p>
If there's good eyesight, light and visible form, but
not consciousness - for instance, if someone is dying but
his physical eyes are still good - then seeing can't
happen. We know that the physical eyes of a dying person
can still be functional because sometimes, after the
person dies, the hospital gives those organs to another
patient. But during the last few moments of life the dying
person cannot see [because sense-consciousness is very
weak at that time].
</p>
<p>
If you only observe what's going on in the present
moment, you'll have to arrive at the truth. You'll
have to understand more and more clearly what the truth of
life is. Because the truth doesn't change. It's
like fire, right? Fire doesn't change. For two, three
or five million years, fire has been hot. Now fire is
still hot. Whoever touches fire knows that. Fire will
still be hot in the future, too.
</p>
<p>
The truth of rupa (matter) and nama (mind) or ultimate
truth is like that, too. It never changes. It's always
the truth. So try to practice until you can understand it.
If you can understand it, your life will be special.
You'll get real benefit from your life. You were
reborn in this life to get benefit from being a human
being, because you have a chance to understand the truth.
</p>
<p>
Well, that's enough about seeing. Now you just have to
practice. There's no rush, no hurry. You have to take
time to make fire from dry bamboo! [Referring to the
practice of generating fire from the friction of two dry
sticks.]
</p>
<p>
Group Interview<br>
<em>[Here Ven. Sopako is referred to as 'Achan,'
which means 'teacher.']</em>
</p>
<p>
Achan: If you don't have a question, you can pass.
Just say you don't have a question. That's all
right. But if someone has a question, I will answer, okay?
</p>
<p>
Student 1: I have two questions.
</p>
<p>
Achan: All right.
</p>
<p>
Student 1: When you're doing the hand motions exercise
[see "How to Meditate"], does it matter that you
do one hand or two, or should you alternate from one to
the other?
</p>
<p>
Achan: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter
whether you do two hands or one [but only move one hand at
a time]. But if you just do one hand and don't
alternate, how will you know whether mindfulness is
balanced or not? Sometimes the movement of one hand is
clear, but when you change to the other hand, mindfulness
is unbalanced or weak. That's why you should try to do
both.
</p>
<p>
Student 1: My other question is, in the
'sitting-touching' exercise [see "How to
Meditate"], when you observe the touching point after
sitting, does it matter where you touch, and should you
touch the same spot each time?
</p>
<p>
Achan: It doesn't matter exactly where you observe
touching. But just stay with one spot until you have
experience touching that point. Don't move around yet.
After that you can move to another point, when mindfulness
is stronger.
</p>
<p>
Student 1: Should the touching point be a place you can
feel?
</p>
<p>
Achan: For a beginner it's important to use a point
where you can feel contact, like your seat touching the
floor. For an advanced Student it doesn't matter. Even
thinking about touching the shoulder or some other point
will be the same. When you add a point, it's just to
add more work for mindfulness. But you should stay on one
point first, until you can move to another one to test
mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
It's like an examination for mindfulness and momentary
concentration to see if they can focus on different points
or not. The touching points don't have any meaning
beyond that. But one point is enough to reach the moment
of rupa and nama [i.e., to experience the moment when the
mind makes contact with an object] and to see arising and
passing away. That's success already. When you move to
many points, it's just for testing if momentary
concentration is strong enough to work with mindfulness.
All right?
</p>
<p>
Student 1: Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Student 2: I have to go back to the earlier question. When
we were sitting or standing, you said we should find some
kind of a focus. When you're in the standing posture
or sitting posture, you use one point and observe that
point to know the posture. Do you visualize your whole
form or do you just use the point?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Just use the point. When you put your hands in
front of you [when standing with the hands clasped] like
this, just focus on your hands. It's the same with
sitting also. Just focus on one hand, right or left, it
doesn't matter. Or just focus on the contact. Focus on
a point that is clear or easy to focus on, a point where
you feel comfortable.
</p>
<p>
It's like taking a picture. [Laughing] Did someone
bring a camera? When you take a picture you focus on one
part of the scene, like this candle for example. If you
don't focus, the picture will be blurry or you'll
get two images - two candles. Then you adjust the images
until they become one. That's correct. But even though
you only focus on one spot, the rest of the picture comes
out clear. It's the same with meditating on posture.
When you focus on the body's posture, just focus on
one point to make it clear. It just depends on where you
want to make the point.
</p>
<p>
Student 2: All right. Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Student 3: I have a big question. If emotions are separate
from self - or from nonself - why are wholesome emotions
important to actually develop? If emotions are nonself,
then why is it important to develop wholesome emotions?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Everything is nonself, all right. Even
consciousness - it's nonself, too. Consciousness is
nonself, unwholesome emotions are nonself, and wholesome
emotions like loving-kindness are nonself. But you're
asking, why do we have to work to develop wholesome
emotions or have wholesome actions? The answer is: in
order to eliminate the unwholesome factors or to balance
the unwholesome.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the unwholesome side of the mind is stronger
than the wholesome. Greed, hatred and delusion are
stronger than mindfulness, wisdom, and loving-kindness -
stronger than the wholesome states of mind. So we need to
use nonself to eliminate or dilute or destroy what is
nonself. When a snake bites you, have to bring -
what's the word? - an antidote. The doctors give you a
shot so the bite does not hurt you anymore. It's the
same thing. We have to use nonself to eliminate nonself.
Another example. When you have coffee that is too strong
or too sweet, you pour some hot water in to dilute it. You
pour the water into the cup and it makes the caffeine and
sugar less and less. But once you've poured it in, you
can't separate the water from the caffeine and sugar.
The coffee and sugar are liquid, too.
</p>
<p>
You've already diluted the coffee, but what happens if
you still pour more water? Maybe you don't want any
more caffeine or sugar in there. You pour more water to
the top of the cup. Then you pour more water again to fill
the cup again. You keep doing that. You taste it. Now the
'coffee' tastes just like pure water. The question
is, where have the sugar and coffee gone? Nobody can find
out, right? Nobody can find out where they've gone.
They're still there, but the amount of water is
greater. But now, mindfulness, loving kindness, and other
wholesome mental factors are present in the mind, but the
unwholesome emotions and hindrances are stronger than
them. That's why they have power to control every
moment of consciousness in daily life. Sometimes the mind
wanders out because it's controlled by greed or
desire, sometimes by hatred, or sometimes it wanders
around following ignorance. When we stay here in this
meditation retreat we use mindfulness to eliminate these
things. We use mindfulness so that greed, hatred and
delusion can't control the mind anymore.
</p>
<p>
When mindfulness can't control the mind directly,
can't stop wandering mind directly, we can use some
technique such as the hand motions exercise. We give it
some object to pay attention to. We give the mind work to
do, something to focus on. That's skillful means.
There's no rush, no hurry. Just slow down. Slow the
mind down. That's the secret to taming the mind.
Before that, consciousness went to the unwholesome side
very fast because greed, hatred and delusion told it,
"You have to go there." You went there.
"You have to get something for me over there."
You did it. They controlled you. They made the mind obey
them very fast. But now we don't let them order the
mind. Instead, we let mindfulness order the mind to stay
here. You move your hand, raising it up or down. Or you
follow the movement of the abdomen as you breathe, or the
movement of the feet in walking meditation.
</p>
<p>
Student 4: Do we wish to completely eliminate labeling
[labeling objects with mental notes], eventually?
</p>
<p>
Achan: In the beginning, meditators label the word or use
a mental note. They are using concentration to support
mindfulness. You have to pay attention to concentrate on
the object. But you can't really eliminate greed,
hatred and delusion yet - not until you feel that you no
longer need to say the mental note. Then you don't
have to focus deliberately or use concentration to stay
with the object, because knowing or seeing happens by
itself. Mindfulness becomes automatic. At that time,
insight or wisdom will eliminate the defilements.
</p>
<p>
When you label the object, you bring concentration to do
the work. Concentration is in charge. But it can't
eliminate greed, hatred and delusion. When you label the
object with a mental note, concentration is in charge.
Concentration is doing it, is observing the object.
</p>
<p>
When you give up labeling the object, knowledge or wisdom
is in charge. In the beginning it's important to label
the object because you need momentary concentration to
support mindfulness so it can stay in the present from
moment to moment. So it can jump from this moment to that
moment. After that, you can give up using the label. All
right?
</p>
<p>
Student 4: Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Student 5: I have two questions. The first is, this
morning you told us to see rising and falling and then
standing [see "How to Meditate."]. And I find
often I don't have - I sort of don't have time in
there before the next breath comes in to label rising and
falling. I can get the label in but then I find what
I'm doing is I'm going on to the next thing . . .
When I stop to really know I'm standing, I've
already started my next breath.
</p>
<p>
Student 1: When he's standing, he observes,
"rising, falling, standing." But by the time he
gets to 'standing,' already he's breathing
again; so maybe he's already falling. [Laughter.] So
he doesn't have time to get all of it in without
hurrying.
</p>
<p>
Achan: If you can't fit in the standing, you have to
hold the breath a little bit. Don't let it go by
itself, automatically. Because we have to use intention
first, just like with the hand motions exercise. We have
to move deliberately first until mindfulness is strong
enough. After that we can move naturally and still be
mindful. But when we're still training, we have to use
the technique. So you have to hold the breath a little bit
until you observe standing for a couple of seconds first.
After that, breathe in and breathe out.
</p>
<p>
Student 5: My other question is, after lunch I lay down
and tried to sleep for five minutes mindfully. Three times
I'd sleep for five minutes and realize I was
completely deluded while I was sleeping. I was dreaming.
When you are sleeping can you have mindfulness?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Usually when sleeping you can't be mindful. If
you have mindfulness you won't dream. If you dream,
that means you don't have mindfulness. Also, how come
you dream right away, after only sleeping five minutes?
Because delusion is waiting for you to lose mindfulness!
Like a thief waiting outside your house to steal
something. When the owner falls asleep the thief comes in
right away. He jumps out. The same thing happens if you
dream after only sleeping five minutes. When you fall
asleep, mindfulness is lost. That means delusion or the
dream state of mind can grow. It knows when you've
lost mindfulness, so it comes up right away.
</p>
<p>
Student 6: I don't have any questions, thank you.
</p>
<p>
Achan: If you don't have a question, how about I ask
you one? [Laughter.] Usually in an interview I have to ask
you, not the other way around.
</p>
<p>
Student 6: Okay [laughter].
</p>
<p>
Achan: When you focus on rising-falling-sitting-touching
[see "How to Meditate"], what is different
between those four objects? Are they different or the
same?
</p>
<p>
Student 6: Each one is different, actually.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Oh, okay. Each one is different. What is the same?
</p>
<p>
Student 6: I suppose at first when I was doing the sitting
and touching I found that I too had to rush to get from
the rising-falling and then quickly do sitting-touching
and back to the rising again before my next breath. And
that was one thing that was different, because my focus
was still on the rising and falling. But gradually, late
this morning, or maybe this afternoon, I was able to
balance it out more so that the breath became shallower
and the focus seemed to be equal on the rising, falling,
sitting and touching. It seemed to have more continuity,
more balance. It seemed to fit in better.
</p>
<p>
Achan: That's true. That's good. That's
correct. When it's imbalanced the time will be
different - maybe rising and falling will be longer than
sitting and touching. When it is balanced, they'll be
the same length of time. When it's balanced, smooth or
equal, which one of the four is clearer or which one do
you see arising and passing away more clearly?
</p>
<p>
Student 6: Actually, now I do have a question! [Laughter.]
I was wondering that this morning. I was wondering which
comes first, because as I was saying the rising and
falling seemed to be more prominent and it seemed to take
a bit of effort to adjust that. Now, is it mindfulness
that is adjusting your knowing - that is adjusting the
object? And then this afternoon, everything seemed to
balance. So what is it - why did it do that? Did it take
the mindfulness to slowly adjust and balance the rupa or
does the rupa balance itself eventually?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Mindfulness has to adjust rupa or adjust the
object. That's why I say that sometimes when
mindfulness is not strong enough it can't adjust the
object. Then you have to take care of mindfulness as if it
were a baby, right? You have to feed the baby until it
grows strong enough. Then it will take care itself. Now,
when mindfulness is not strong or not balanced enough, we
have to adjust the object for mindfulness. For example, we
have to hold the breath a little bit. Something like that.
We make adjustments for mindfulness. When mindfulness
becomes strong enough to balance with concentration, it
will adjust automatically.
</p>
<p>
Student 7: I know this is out of turn, but a question has
arisen because I found I did something different. I
didn't adjust my breath. What I did - and I don't
know, maybe I did it wrong - is I thought about it [the
sitting and touching] just as any other awareness and I
tried to shift my awareness. I knew the breath was still
going but I kind of let go of that thought and moved to
sitting. Kind of like you know there's a sound in the
background. But instead of adjusting my breath I just let
it go to the back of my mind. I don't know if that is
right?
</p>
<p>
Student 1: I did the same thing. And I did the same thing
with standing. I knew rising and falling was occurring
again, but I just put my attention on to standing.
</p>
<p>
Student 7: I tried to adjust but I felt I was controlling
rather than watching.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes, you have to use a little control at first . .
.
</p>
<p>
Student 7: [Laughing] I didn't like that.
</p>
<p>
Achan: I know [Laughing]. But as I said, you have to make
a deliberate object first, until mindfulness is balanced
or strong enough. Then mindfulness will adjust itself.
It's the same thing when you walk six-step, right?
[Referring to a meditation exercise in which each step
consists of six individual movements.] After mindfulness
has enough experience walking that way using momentary
concentration, you can walk normally, just slower.
</p>
<p>
Then how slow or fast you walk depends on mindfulness. If
you're moving too fast, mindfulness will
'tell' you to slow down. If too slow, mindfulness
will adjust to make you go faster. You don't just walk
six-step all the time, forever. When you've trained
enough you can give up that exercise. Then you allow
mindfulness to adjust things by itself. That time you can
get benefit because mindfulness will eliminate the
defilements in your mind.
</p>
<p>
When you're training now, you can't eliminate
greed, hatred and delusion yet - not until mindfulness
becomes steady and can adjust things by itself.
Mindfulness has two duties: one, to know the object in the
present moment; two, to destroy greed, hatred and delusion
in the mind from moment to moment. But these two
aren't really separate. When you mindfully observe
what's going on in the present, from moment to moment,
the defilements can't catch the object [of your
awareness]. That's the same as mindfulness destroying
them.
</p>
<p>
There's just one action, seeing the truth. But
whenever mindfulness does that, it dilutes the defilements
at the same time. By the language there are two things
happening. By the truth, it's only one. When you keep
observing in the present moment the defilements can't
follow, can't cling to anything. [Turning to next
Student] How are you?
</p>
<p>
Student 8: A lot of sleepiness.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Can you focus on rising and falling?
</p>
<p>
Student 8: Just sitting-touching. There doesn't seem
to be enough for mindfulness [there aren't enough
objects for mindfulness to focus on]. The mind is off
doing things.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You need more concentration. That's why you
have to label the object with a mental note. Do you label
or not?
</p>
<p>
Student 8: When I'm awake. [Laughter.]
</p>
<p>
Achan: [Laughing] Sure, when you're asleep how can you
label the object? But I prefer you to observe rising and
falling. Can you do that?
</p>
<p>
Student 8: It's too much control. I can't breathe.
When I pay attention to the breath it gets so controlled I
can't breathe any more.
</p>
<p>
Achan: That's why I need to give you instruction
separately. You have to interview with me in private.
Yesterday I asked you, "How come you can breathe in
front of me now? It's not very hard. You're not
nervous." Now you can breathe. How come, when you
focus on the breath, you can't breathe? It's just
mental.
</p>
<p>
Student 8: Yes. But that's how it is right now.
</p>
<p>
Achan: In a case like this, you should work with the
teacher. You have to allow the leader to help. Not just
doing it by yourself, I know. I can help so that while you
breathe in and breathe out you can observe the abdomen
rising and falling. If you just observe sitting and
touching - that object is too difficult for mindfulness to
catch in the beginning. That gives the mind a chance to
wander a lot. That's why you say, "not enough for
mindfulness." Not enough things to observe to make
your mind quiet or less restless or stop it from wandering
out.
</p>
<p>
As long as I'm still here, if you can do
rising-falling, then add sitting after that, you'll
have less and less wandering mind. The sitting and
touching objects are very deep. Mindfulness can't
catch them, can't stay with a deeper level of the
object. But rising and falling is easy because you can
feel the movement of the stomach when it expands and falls
back.
</p>
<p>
If you can't feel the sensation of the stomach moving
as you breathe, you can put your hand on your abdomen like
this. [Achan puts hand on stomach.] If you can't feel
the movement with your hand when you breathe in, you have
to know the sensation here. There are many ways to try to
catch the present moment first. That's all right - I
will give you instruction in the afternoon, okay?
</p>
<p>
Student 8: Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Achan: [Turning to next Student] What do you have?
</p>
<p>
Student 9: What do I have? Big problems! [Laughter.]
</p>
<p>
Achan: Sleepiness or what?
</p>
<p>
Student 9: If the concentration isn't strong, if the
concentration is weak on the mindfulness of
rising-falling, should you direct your attention to the
rise and fall, perhaps to the point where you are
controlling the breath? You want something, and so
you're controlling the breath. You're not just
letting it happen on its own. Am I to understand that
it's okay to do that, to control the breath until
mindfulness is stronger?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Not when just doing rising-falling by itself. Then
you shouldn't try to control the breath. Only when you
are doing 'rising-falling' together with
'sitting and touching.' Then if you can't fit
sitting and touching in before breathing in again, you
should wait or hold the breath for a second or should
control it a little bit.
</p>
<p>
You're waiting for concentration and mindfulness to
become strong or balanced enough to adjust the object, to
make all four of them equal. You haven't been
practicing long enough to be able to adjust that yet. As
you practice more, it will become balanced or equal. You
have to take time to adjust or balance.
</p>
<p>
Student 9: The mindfulness isn't always strong. So
when it changes, when mindfulness is weak, then does the
Student need to do the job? When mindfulness becomes weak,
is it your duty as a meditator to change that? Should you
be making effort to change mindfulness to make it
stronger?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Sometimes. It depends on why it's weak. If you
know that mindfulness is weak because you've stayed
too long on one object, then you have to change to another
position or change the object. But if mindfulness is weak
because it can't handle the job of observing, in that
case you don't do anything to change it. Just keep
trying, keep practicing and wait for it to become strong
enough.
</p>
<p>
Student 1: I just wanted to say something about
controlling the breath. Everybody's concerned about
the fact that that's control, but I think what Achan
is saying is, when you know it's control, you're
doing something with knowledge anyway, so it doesn't
matter. At a point in time you will just know what's
going on. It's when you do things with no knowledge
associated with what we're doing, yet our defilements
are still controlling it. But there are some things we
need to take right effort towards. And changing
mindfulness when it's weak constitutes right effort.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes, that's true. Thank you. But again, we
don't always try to change mindfulness when it's
weak. It depends on what the reason is. [Turning to next
Student.] How are you today?
</p>
<p>
Student 10: I'm having no difficulty with the
focusing. That's fine and the walking is fine and the
sitting is fine. But there are times when I seem to be
very sleepy and it's like somebody shook up the water
because the defilements are quite strong.
</p>
<p>
Achan: During sitting and walking?
</p>
<p>
Student 10: Walking is fine and standing is fine. It's
when I'm sitting that I have the problem with the
defilements and the sleepiness. Not all the time. It just
seems to come and then mindfulness returns but I have no
trouble, when I'm mindful, with the focusing. It's
just I have trouble. . . when I'm sleepy. . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: It doesn't matter how much sleepiness you have.
Let mindfulness focus on sleepiness until you can't
have mindfulness anymore because the sleepiness is
stronger. If you fall asleep, that's all right. Let
the sleepiness be there until you're able to know it
or have mindfulness again. When you have mindfulness
again, just continue from that moment. Begin again from
that moment - in that case, the sleepiness hasn't
interrupted your continuity.
</p>
<p>
Student 10: Well, that's what I've been doing. But
I'd just like to eliminate the sleepiness.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You have to take time. Because sleepiness makes
your energy weak. It makes consciousness weak. That's
why mindfulness can't stay at the level. Wait until
you have more concentration. Having stronger concentration
will help to eliminate sleepiness. But you haven't had
time yet. You haven't practiced long enough to make
concentration strong enough to eliminate sleepiness yet.
It's the duty of concentration, not mindfulness, to
eliminate the five hindrances: lust, anger, sleepiness,
restlessness and doubt. But you have to take time to set
up concentration first.
</p>
<p>
Student 10: So I need more concentration.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You need more, but it's not necessary to
practice a concentration technique directly. When you know
that sleepiness is happening, just have the attitude,
"All right, let the hindrances arise. I don't
care." Try to keep observing with mindfulness, keep
going with the objects of mindfulness, as much as you can.
Don't care about sleepiness, or wandering mind, or
anger. When you feel angry, just be aware. Focus and
forget it. Just keep going that way.
</p>
<p>
Student 10: I have another question. Could you explain to
me the difference between when you say to use clear
comprehension and use mindfulness? What is clear
comprehension?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Clear comprehension and momentary concentration are
two different factors that support mindfulness. Clear
comprehension is like this. Right now, can you just move
your hand like this? [Achan demonstrates. The Student
moves her hand.] Move your hand up, then down. And move
your hand up again, and down. Now, as you were moving, you
knew it, right? You were aware of the movement. That is
clear comprehension working with mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
But now move your hand this way. [Achan demonstrating].
When you concentrate more deliberately and break the
movement into steps, stopping between each step, you can
clearly see the whole movement from beginning to end. That
means that concentration is helping mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
It's the same when we do the six-step walking
exercise, or the four-step sitting exercise [i.e., the
"rising-falling-sitting-touching" exercise], or
the hand motions exercise. In all of these we use
concentration to support mindfulness. When you have enough
concentration you can stop labeling the object with a
mental note. Then you can walk more normally when
practicing. You can move naturally. At that time
you're using clear comprehension to support
mindfulness. But first you have to get experience using
momentary concentration to support mindfulness. After that
you can give up the step-by-step technique.
</p>
<p>
The Satipatthana Sutta [Discourse on the Four Foundations
of Mindfulness] says to observe the 'body in the
body' with 'atapi,' 'satima' and
'sampajanno.' 'With atapi' means with
right effort or right energy. Satima means to have
mindfulness. Sampajanno means to have clear comprehension.
These three qualities can eliminate or destroy greed and
hatred right away, that moment.
</p>
<p>
That means to practice without labeling the object,
without using the step-by-step technique. Just doing it
with effort, mindfulness and clear comprehension. Then
you'll eliminate greed and hatred right away. Delusion
won't happen because mindfulness automatically
prevents delusion from arising. When you're able to
give up labeling the object, when you can give up the
step-by-step technique and still observe the objects
appearing before you, without a break, you'll know by
yourself that mindfulness is steady. You'll feel it.
You'll be able to focus right away without trying,
without using intention to focus. At that time you're
using clear comprehension to support mindfulness, not
momentary concentration.
</p>
<p>
Student 10: Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Achan: You're welcome. [Turning to next Student] How
are you?
</p>
<p>
Student 11: This morning I became very aware of
impermanence for quite awhile. And that was okay. But
after awhile I started feeling very sad. So I tried not to
pay attention to that too much and focus on the walking.
But sadness was still very strongly in the background. And
I was very aware of impermanence too. So it was like there
were too many balls in the air, and I wasn't sure what
to pay attention to.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Just pay attention to impermanence more than
sadness, more than what is in the background. Sadness
comes from what you are seeing. When you see clearly you
have to have a feeling, like sadness, or sorrow, or
emptiness. Or sometimes you can feel happy, too.
"Wow, now I'm seeing the truth," or
something like that. Many kinds of feelings can arise from
seeing clearly. So just be aware and keep going with
observing impermanence, all right?
</p>
<p>
Student 11: Sadness kept getting in the way.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Sometimes it will get in the way, but sometimes it
will be in the background - that's all right. Until
you can pass that level. Until you can get the next level
of knowledge. Now it's like you're driving a car
to Edmonton. You have to pass the Rocky Mountains. You can
see both sides of the highway. In some places it's
dangerous, in others there's a beautiful view. I
don't know . . . I've never driven to Edmonton!
[Laughter.] Maybe that's a bad example. It's the
same thing when you practice at the level you're at
now. As you keep going you still see both sides of the
way. When you haven't passed those things, you still
have good and bad scenery along the way.
</p>
<p>
Student 11: Except it was a little bit like driving
underwater for awhile. [Laughter.]
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes, that's right. Anything else? That's
good you can keep going, all right? Until you really make
sure for yourself that everything is impermanent. When you
see impermanence clearly in the present, right now, very
clearly with one moment, you'll understand that all
the moments in the past were the same way. They were just
as impermanent. And any moments that come in the future
will be impermanent, too, just like the present moment
right now.
</p>
<p>
Then you won't be able to attach too much with the
moments from the past or cling too much to something
you're expecting in the future. When you see that,
your mind will calm down. Usually, people always cling to
something in the past, or else they think about something
in the future. That makes them very heavy because they
carry both. They carry an empty thing from the past and an
empty thing from the future! They always carry them. That
makes them heavy.
</p>
<p>
When you understand the truth that everything from the
past is gone already, and that whatever happens in the
future will be gone, too, you'll see that all of it is
impermanent, just occurring from moment to moment only.
Nothing is permanent at all. Then it's like you drop
something that you've been carrying for a long time.
You feel, "Wow, now my life is very light." When
you give up or let go of something you carry in your mind,
you'll see the truth and your life will become
lighter.
</p>
<p>
Student 11: Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Student 12: There's one thing I wanted to ask. When I
was doing sitting-touching, particularly on the touching -
unless it was delusion - I became aware that it was nama
touching rupa. It was like my mind, the nama, was touching
the body. Is that right or is that delusion?
</p>
<p>
Achan: That's right. It's just mental touching or
nama touching the object. That's right. Sometimes nama
makes an object, makes a rupa. Sometime rupa makes an
object for nama. They work together. When a sound comes
up, for example, that's rupa making nama arise.
</p>
<p>
Student 12: I was aware that they were very separate.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes, that's right.
</p>
<p>
Student 12: And that's all there was. That's all.
It was just nama and rupa.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes, just nama and rupa. But we need to see them as
they arise together or make contact in the present moment
to make a complete object for mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
Student 12: Yes, yes.
</p>
<p>
Achan: For example, in the sitting and touching exercise,
the mind 'makes' an object. How? The mind puts its
attention on a certain spot on the body [the
touching-point] for mindfulness to focus on. You just
focus and forget it. After you 'forget it,' the
object is no longer there, because the mind isn't
'making' it anymore. The mind isn't focusing
on it.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't matter how the sitting posture or the
touch-point appears to you or what it looks like. It
doesn't matter. Because the mind just focuses there,
just makes an object for mindfulness at that moment. When
the mind focuses, the object arises in the present. If
nama [mind] doesn't 'make' the object in the
present moment like that, by focusing on it, then we
can't use the posture as an object for mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
We've been sitting here a long time, more than an
hour. How can the sitting posture be 'in the present
moment'? The mind has to make it an object of
awareness by focusing in the present, knowing,
"sitting, sitting, sitting," one moment after
the next. In that case, sitting becomes an object in the
present moment, now.
</p>
<p>
It's the same thing with touching. The mind makes a
touching point into the object of mindfulness right now,
in the present moment. Mindfulness focuses on that point
and then forgets it. If you don't forget it, if you
describe it further: "the point feels like this,
it's a good or bad sensation," and so on,
that's too long.
</p>
<p>
Description is not the duty of mindfulness. It's the
duty of perception, of mental formations, to know whether
the touching point is good or bad or feels smooth or hard
or not. That's too much. It makes liking and disliking
arise afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Student 12: When that happens, what should you do? For
example, this morning when I was walking I was very aware
of my foot touching the carpet. And that became something
very noticeable. So as I was touching I was also noting
the carpet. That, presumably, is pulling some perception
into it that is unnecessary. What do I do?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Even physical touching - just pay attention to
knowing or feeling the touch of the carpet. Don't
describe whether it's soft, or hard, or good, or bad.
When you just know the touch, when you're just aware
of the feeling of touching the carpet or something,
that's already enough. Forget it. If you don't
forget it, then mental formations will come in to describe
how the carpet looks, or how it feels to touch it. That
makes liking and disliking arise. That's not correct.
</p>
<p>
We try to give up liking and disliking with touching,
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling and thinking.
If you still focus on the object until liking and
disliking arise, you don't have mindfulness at all.
You're staying on the object too long.
</p>
<p>
For example, if you look at the Buddha statue until you
think, "This statue must come from Thailand because
it looks like the Thai style," that's too much.
Just seeing the object is enough. You don't need to
describe it at all. It doesn't matter what kind of
shape the Buddha statue has, or where it comes from.
That's true no matter what object you're
observing. If you describe the object, you'll make
liking and disliking happen. That means you're staying
with the object too long, all right?
</p>
<p>
Student 12: So, when that happens, what do you do to
counter that?
</p>
<p>
Achan: Just forget it! [Laughter]. Just drop that object.
You have to learn how to forget! You'd better stay
three more days to learn that. [Laughter.] This time
you're just learning how to continue. In Edmonton
maybe you can forget it.
</p>
<p>
When you've already described an object, there's
nothing to do with it at that point. Just begin again with
the next object. When you've lost mindfulness, just
say, "Okay," and don't care about what
happened in the past moment. It happened already. It's
over. Just begin again now. It's never too late.
Mindfulness will always come when you begin again. If the
mind wanders out for five minutes, then as soon as you
know you've lost mindfulness, just begin again from
that spot. You can't do anything about the wandering
because it's happened already. It's gone already.
</p>
<p>
Student 3: I think, once you're mindful of it, then
you can drop it and start again. So it's just a matter
of making that note, noting feeling, or experiencing, and
then starting again. It may come back again and again, but
each time it's going to be weaker. It's like the
water in the coffee.
</p>
Achan: Yes. That's right. [Turning to the next Student.]
How about you?<br>
<br>
<p>
Student 13: Well, someone else started touching on
something that happened to me right before lunch. I really
thought I knew nama and rupa but then all of a sudden I
was so confused I couldn't separate. And I really
wanted to be aware. So I took the easy way out and went to
lunch and focused on liking and disliking! [Laughter.]
Although I found I also have a category of feelings I
didn't have a label for and that's -
'don't care.' Anyway I was really quite
confused because I wasn't sure anymore that I knew
what nama was and rupa was. I lost my awareness of where
they were in the moment.
</p>
<p>
Achan: That's the problem when meditators have too
much desire to know what rupa is and what nama is, or how
they can separate the two or . . . it makes the meditator
confused. Usually we don't use the mental notes
"rupa" and "nama." You don't have
to memorize the name of the object. That's not a big
deal. If you're still in the moment of truth, that
means rupa and nama are there.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes you can stay with rupa but nama is there too.
Sometime you can know nama but rupa is there. Rupa means
that the object [of the mind] is there, is present. The
object of nama is still showing. When you're in the
present moment exactly, you can't separate the two.
When you see a picture you can't separate the image,
the eye and seeing.
</p>
<p>
Like when I lit a match this morning - when the match
contacts the friction strip and fire burns the match, you
can't separate the three things: fire, match, and
strip. Because when they harmonize, everything is complete
to generate fire to burn something up. The present moment
is like that, too. So just give up thinking about what
rupa is and what nama is.
</p>
<p>
Student 13: Okay, so just dropping it as I did . . . I
just let it kind of go. So that's the thing to do
then. I changed my focus. It's that I was knowing . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes, just use knowing only. When a good thing is
happening, you know it. When a bad thing is happening you
know. When you're confused, you know it. After knowing
the object, forget it. Forget it means, once you have
observed the object for a moment, it's already in the
past.
</p>
<p>
It isn't the duty of mindfulness to keep going with an
object from the past. Only an object in the present
moment. As soon as you know what's happening right
now, with that object, you've finished the duty of
mindfulness. So you drop that object and observe the next
moment.
</p>
<p>
Student 13: It may come up again, but that's okay . .
.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Yes. If it comes up again, just know it again and
forget it again. And if it comes again, just know it again
and forget it again. There are many kinds of objects, but
all of them become food for mindfulness. Also, when they
become objects of mindfulness they give it something to
'step' on.
</p>
<p>
When an object is happening, mindfulness focuses directly
to the present moment of that object, that arising. It
takes one step on the path. Then the next object arises.
It doesn't matter what it is. If mindfulness focuses
in the present moment without describing the object,
without worry or confusion, just focusing and forgetting,
that becomes the second step. Mindfulness has taken two
steps along the path.
</p>
<p>
When the next object comes up, mindfulness jumps again -
three, four, five steps. It continues walking, getting
closer and closer to the end of the way. But if you're
confused about the technique, that means that mindfulness
can't jump, can't step. It just stops. Practice
slows down.
</p>
<p>
If you're not worried, if you just allow everything
that arises in the present to become food for mindfulness,
you can keep going without a break. You just focus and
forget it. Whether it's a body object, feeling,
consciousness or mind-object doesn't matter.
</p>
<p>
Right now you're sitting here. What is happening? If
nothing else arises, no thoughts, no emotions, no
feelings, you just stay with
'rising-falling-sitting-touching' [see "How
to Meditate."]. Each moment that you note what's
happening, mindfulness takes a step forward on the path.
It's walking on the path right now, this moment. When
wandering mind appears, just use mindfulness to focus on
wandering mind. That's one step. And back to take a
step with a body-object or emotion. Mindfulness can jump
to observe an emotion. That's another step. Everything
that comes up is useful for mindfulness. Everything that
comes up provides a path for mindfulness to walk on all
the time, all day and all night.
</p>
<p>
Nobody knows how long the wheel of samsara [the round of
birth and death] is. Nobody knows where we came from. How
many lives have we lived in the past? Nobody can say. How
many times will we be reborn in the future? Nobody knows.
That's ignorance. The question is, how can we shorten
the wheel of samsara until we have no more than seven
lives in the future?
</p>
<p>
Someone who reduces the number of future incarnations to
seven is a person who has already entered the stream to
nibbana [the cessation of suffering], called a
streamwinner [sotapanna]. They have reached the first
stage of enlightenment. They can't be reborn in
samsara more than seven times.
</p>
<p>
Unless we reach the level of streamwinner, nobody can say
how many times we'll be reborn. No one can guarantee.
No one can count. It's like an ant walking on the rim
of a cup, here [points to a coffee cup in front of him].
It just keeps walking - walk, walk, walk, walk - all day
and all night. When you ask where it came from, the ant
says, "I don't know." Where is it going?
"I don't know that, either." How long until
you reach the end? "I don't know."
</p>
<p>
Because there's no end, right? A circle has no end, no
beginning. It's the same with the wheel of birth and
death of all beings. Maybe it's not far, but we
can't know where the end is. But when we make a spot
for it here [leans pen against the side of the cup] the
ant can walk down. Then it will know by itself, "Now
I've come to the end." It can't go any
farther along the rim.
</p>
<p>
In the same way, when we try to stay in the present moment
we'll know how far it is to the end of samsara. Maybe
it's not too far. When we have mindfulness focusing on
one moment, directly in the present, the future in samsara
gets shorter and shorter all the time. Until we get closer
to nibbana and have only seven lives left. That means
you'll become enlightened and eliminate incarnations
and stop the wheel of samsara. You'll have shortened
the wheel. You'll have broken away from samsara.
That's the reason for practicing insight meditation,
all right? [Turning to next Student] How are you?
</p>
<p>
Student 14: I think it's going okay, but when I'm
sitting and doing
"rising-falling-sitting-touching," somehow
they're all the same. It started with touching and
sitting being the same, but on occasion the rising and
falling are the same too. They're all distinct points
but they're . . .
</p>
<p>
Achan: The same moment, right?
</p>
<p>
Student 14: No, they're different moments in time.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Oh, different moments. . . What is the same?
</p>
<p>
Student 14: I have to say to myself this is breathing,
this is. . . I have to take more effort to keep them
separate. Do you understand what I'm saying? It's
not always like that, just sometimes. And I know, I mean I
know that I'm on touching or on breathing. But the
sensation is the same. No difference in sensation.
</p>
<p>
Achan: Okay. But what is different?
</p>
<p>
Student 14: Just that I know that they're different.
They feel the same.
</p>
<p>
Achan: All right, they're not different by the
sensation. When you know the object right now in the
present, from moment to moment, each object will seem the
same. That's what I meant by "the same
moment." [They are not qualitatively different.]
Because every moment is just arising and passing away, the
same as every other. That's what I mean by saying that
every object is the same. The difference might be that
some objects are clear and some are not quite clear.
That's what I mean when I ask, "What is
different?"
</p>
<p>
Student 14: Well, when they all seem the same to me,
they're all equally clear.
</p>
<p>
Achan: If all of them are equally clear, that means the
continuity of mindfulness is steady and balanced when you
observe objects from moment to moment. So you're just
waiting. You have to take more time to see clearly until
you have a feeling of sadness or some kind of fear a
little bit, like, "Wow! I can't attach anymore
because everything is just arising and passing away right
away, right now. Everything is changing. Everything is
impermanent. There's no way it can be permanent."
Impermanence will be clearer and make you have some
feeling from seeing the truth. There are many different
kinds of feeling that can happen. All right? [Laughing]
You're almost there!
