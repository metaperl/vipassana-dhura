<p>
The Four Noble Truths. I hope that all of you who have
studied abhidhamma [Buddhist metaphysics] will understand
the Four Noble Truths. The Four Noble Truths are: one,
[that all formations are] suffering, or
unsatisfactoriness, dukkha; two, the cause of suffering
[desire or craving, tanha]; three, the end of suffering
[the extinction of craving, nirodha]; four, the eight-fold
path [leading to the end of suffering, magga].
</p>
<p>
Just four; only four truths to know. And even when nobody
knows them, they still exist by themselves. You still have
them with you now, even if you do not know them. You still
have ultimate truth existing by itself. But when someone
practices until he knows suffering, then suffering becomes
special for him [as a consequence of seeing suffering
clearly one arrives at supramundane happiness.] That's
the meaning of "noble." I'll just mention
the Pali name for the Four Noble Truths: ariya sacca.
</p>
<p>
"Ariya" means "noble";
"sacca" means "truth." The truth is
rupa and nama. Even when nobody knows it, it is still
true. But then it is just plain truth. It isn't
"noble" yet, right? When you practice insight
meditation you can see the truth; then it becomes noble,
then it becomes excellent for you and eliminates the
defilements [i.e., greed, hatred and delusion]. That's
important to know.
</p>
<p>
That's why, for enlightenment, according Buddhism, you
have to see suffering, have to understand the cause of
suffering, have to know the end of suffering, and you have
to complete the eight-fold path by practicing correctly,
by going on the right path. That's the meaning of
enlightenment. When you complete these things, when you
understand suffering, when you know about the cause of
suffering and can understand its end, that's the
meaning of enlightenment.
</p>
<p>
How about you? Are you almost complete or not? [Laughter.]
I think almost, someone. If you understand what suffering
is. Right now, when you're sitting in meditation, how
can you know what suffering is? Suffering [dukkha] does
not mean pain or unpleasant physical or mental feeling,
no. That's not the meaning of suffering in the Four
Noble Truths. Suffering is: rupa [material phenomena] and
nama [mind or mental phenomena].
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="cause"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">The Cause of Suffering Why Do We Meditate?</a></p>

<p>
What is rupa? What is nama? I tell you
all the time that sitting is rupa. [The phenomenon
that's sitting is rupa, material form, not a person.]
Knowing is nama. That's unsatisfactoriness or
suffering. That is suffering. Now, when you know that rupa
and nama are suffering, when you focus on them, do you see
that or not? Sometimes you see it, I know, but it's
not quite clear, or not strong enough. It doesn't go
deep enough to the truth exactly. But sometimes, maybe,
it's clear. That means that you understand suffering.
You have the first of the Four Noble Truths already! [
Laughter.] When you're sitting and meditating, whether
you focus on the sitting posture itself, or on
rising-falling, it's the same, because both of them
are rupa and nama. [You can see dukkha,
unsatisfactoriness, equally well no matter which nama-rupa
you are observing.] That's suffering, right? What is
the cause of suffering? When you sit in meditation, after
twenty or thirty minutes you might feel pain or numbness.
It's uncomfortable to continue. When you feel pain,
you have disliking - nobody likes pain, right? Disliking
means vibhava-tanha [the desire for nonexistence or the
desire to eliminate something.] Disliking is desire, too.
</p>
<p>
Most people understand desire to mean liking or wanting
something. But according to the second Noble Truth, the
cause of suffering, even disliking is desire. Why?
Because, when you don't like pain, you want to change.
When you don't like this one, you like that other one.
</p>
<p>
You don't want to sit anymore; you want to change.
That means that you still have desire from suffering.
[Desire still arises with the object, even when the object
itself is undesirable.] So, whenever you have pain, and
you dislike the feeling, that is a cause of suffering.
</p>
<p>
When you don't like the old posture, the old position,
you want to change. That's kama-tanha [sensual
craving; in this case, the desire to find a comfortable
posture. Kama-tanha states the same picture in positive
terms - the desire to obtain pleasant feeling as opposed
to the wish to get rid of unpleasant feeling.]
</p>
<p>
Now, when you actually change position, a third kind of
desire is operating, called "bhava-tanha." [This
is the desire for continued becoming. It is a belief that
change itself can bring happiness. You want to try
something different from what you have now in the hope
that it will be better. That hope is based on ignorance of
the real characteristics of nama and rupa. You continue to
have misplaced faith in the objects of mind and matter,
continue to believe that they might yield up some
happiness if only you could get the right ones; so you
keep desiring something new. Whenever bhava tanha is
present you still perceive objects in ordinary terms,
knowing their conventional names; you don't yet see
them in ultimate terms, as simply namas and rupas that
arise only to vanish. When seen as namas and rupas, there
can be no hope that a different nama or rupa will provide
happiness.]
</p>
<p>
So there are three kinds of desire that can arise as a
result of the sitting posture: vibhava-tanha, kama-tanha,
and bhava-tanha. Disliking something, liking something,
and the desire for change.
</p>
<p>
But when you change posture [without awareness] you do not
know that the cause of suffering is still there. [Although
you are perpetuating suffering, generating its cause
afresh by acting out of desire, you don't realize
this. On the contrary, you believe that you're
improving things.] When you have pain you want to change
postures; but when you change position without focusing,
that's desire.
</p>
<p>
That's why I say that you have to keep focusing even
when you have pain, right? [In order to break the
cause-and-effect cycle of suffering we have to act with
awareness instead of automatically following desire. Even
when we feel pain we shouldn't let ourselves react by
changing position automatically.] Understand that you have
to change [posture], rather than thinking, "I want to
change." Whenever you feel, "I want to
change," desire is present; so you continue to
generate the cause that results in suffering. [In the
future you will have to experience the result of that
desire, namely: unsatisfactoriness, unhappiness, dukkha.]
</p>
<p>
But when you understand that you have to change
<em>[because you are too uncomfortable to continue
practicing mindfulness effectively]</em> then you can stop
the cause of suffering; you have eliminated vibhava tanha
[disliking] already. In that case, when changing posture
you focus on every small movement, step-by-step. You have
mindfulness all the time, and so you eliminate bhava
tanha. That is, you are not expecting to get permanent
happiness from the new posture. You understand that even
the new posture is suffering, too; that it isn't
happiness at all. [The new posture is also unsatisfactory
because it, too, is just rupa. And according to the first
Noble Truth, all rupas and namas across the board are
dukkha, unsatisfactoriness.] Whenever you act mindfully
like this while practicing meditation you destroy desire,
the cause of suffering, every moment. That means that you
have passed the second of the Four Noble Truths.
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="third"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">The Third Noble Truth</a></p>

<p>The third Noble
Truth does not really mean nibbana yet. Here it means
destroying liking and disliking while you are focusing in
the present, from one moment to the next. If you can focus
in the present from moment-to-moment every time that you
change posture or see, hear, smell, taste, or touch,
without liking or disliking, that means that you can get
the third Noble Truth, the end of suffering. Why is this
the end of suffering?
</p>
<p>
When you have liking, you still have suffering [dukkha]
present. When you have disliking, you still have suffering
there from seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching,
sitting, standing, walking and moving. If you feel liking
or disliking with any activity, that means that you still
have the cause of suffering there [i.e., you still have
desire]. But when you are free of liking or disliking you
can finish dukkha; the end of suffering is right there.
</p>
<p>
So when you see a Buddha statue, for example, just be
aware of seeing. That means to separate the [concept of
the] Buddha from the color itself. Seeing the Buddha image
[rather than bare color] is a matter of perception or
memory attaching with the image. But when you separate the
concept of the Buddha image from [the act of] seeing or
from color itself, then you cannot feel liking or
disliking at all. But if you have attachment to the Buddha
image, then you will have to feel liking or disliking. If
it is a beautiful picture you'll like it; if it's
an ugly picture you will dislike it, right?
</p>
<p>
But when you "just see," when you just see
color, when you separate the name or the meaning of the
picture from the actual color, then you destroy liking and
disliking right away. Liking means greed, desire (tanha).
Disliking means hatred. You don't need to worry about
delusion because, when you have mindfulness, delusion is
already gone. It is the same as in this room; when you
turn on the light you don't need to make the darkness
go out, because it's gone already. It's very
important to understand how you can give up liking and
disliking whenever you see, hear, smell, taste, touch,
sit, stand, walk, etc. Whenever you can be without liking
or disliking in your practice you are completing the third
Noble Truth.
</p>
<div class="line"></div>

<a name="righteffort"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Right Effort</a></p>

<p>
Just waiting for number four 
[i.e., the meditator is waiting to complete the fourth
Noble Truth, which is the eight-fold path. The eight-fold
path is: right effort, right mindfulness, right
concentration, right action, right speech, right
livelihood, right view and right thought.] Number four
means to try to make effort all the time. Even when you
are tired, try to do the hand motions - even when you are
very tired and the hand seems very heavy [Sopako Bhikkhu
is referring to the hand-motions exercise. See, "How
to Meditate."] When you are tired or you feel lazy,
the hand can feel like a stone. How can you raise it? But
you have to make effort; you have to do it even when you
feel lazy because you want to complete the fourth Noble
Truth. So you have to do the work, you have to continue
making objects for mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
Then you can complete right effort. Also, you have
mindfulness to focus. And you continue moving the hand,
raising it up, touching, moving. Or you continue to make
effort by observing rising-falling or sitting-touching.
["Rising-falling" refers to the abdominal
movements that occur during breathing,
"sitting-touching" to an exercise that observes
the sitting posture and a touching point. See, "How
to Meditate."] Or you can make effort by focusing on
hearing or thinking. Or if some emotion arises -
confusion, worry, or restlessness - you can focus on
emotion. Then you are making right effort with a mental
object.
</p>
<p>
If nothing else happens you can just continue observing
body objects: rising-falling-sitting-touching [another
meditation exercise]. That means that you are completing
the factors of right effort, right mindfulness and right
concentration during every moment of your practice. Also,
when you make effort to observe
rising-falling-sitting-touching, or when you move one hand
at a time, stand up, walk step-by-step, and go back to
sitting again, when you keep going step-by-step, one
movement at a time from moment-to-moment, that is the
meaning of right action.
</p>
<p>
Why should you move the hand mindfully? Because you want
to complete the factor of right action. If I want to
drink, and I just move the hand to take water, that is not
right action, because I am not making right effort. I
don't have mindfulness to focus. I do not continue
observing from moment-to-moment. [Demonstrating drinking
water without mindfulness.] Right action would be: when I
am thirsty I look at the water, noting "seeing,
seeing." Then I focus on the thirst; I observe the
feeling of thirstiness. Then I observe the intention to
move the hand. I raise the hand [demonstrating], move it
straight, move it down until it touches the cup. Then I
take the cup, bring it to the mouth, open the mouth
[drinking water]. . . that means right action. With every
moment, with every action, with every movement, with every
step from one moment to the next, I have effort, I have
mindfulness, and I have continuity. I continue to observe
objects without a break.
</p>
<p>
This constitutes right livelihood also. Right action,
right speech and right livelihood will harmonize with the
first three factors: right effort, right mindfulness and
right concentration. [When the meditator maintains
continuity of practice during a retreat, he automatically
has right livelihood. Since noble silence is maintained
during retreats, he also has right speech.]
</p>
<p>
So you have six [of the eight path-factors] already. If
you continue to practice, then right view and right
thought will come after that, when all the factors
harmonize. Then you will be able to see arising and
passing away or impermanence, suffering, and not-selfness
very clearly, more and more deeply.
</p>
<p>
It's like different shades of white. At first your
shirt looks white. But if you have a purer shade of white
to compare to the shirt, you can see some spots. Then you
feel, "Wow, my shirt is dirty." It's the
same when you see impermanence clearly; it becomes more
and more subtle.
</p>
<p>
That means that you are practicing the Four Noble Truths,
which will be complete when the eight-fold path is
complete, when you can practice the entire eight-fold path
in one moment, each moment. When that happens, many groups
of dhamma will come together in your mind. [These
"groups" are the thirty-seven requisites of
enlightenment.]
</p>
<p>
The "Four Foundations of Mindfulness" constitute
the first group. You will complete that, too, when you
practice the Four Noble Truths because sitting, standing,
walking, lying down, and rising-falling are all body
objects [they belong to the first foundation of
mindfulness]. Feeling objects include unpleasant, pleasant
and neutral feeling [the second foundation]. Wandering
mind or thinking is a consciousness object [the third
foundation]. Emotions or hindrances are mental objects
<em>[the fourth foundation]</em>. But you are completing
these already by practicing the Four Noble Truths. So one
group - the four foundations of mindfulness - is being
completed already.
</p>
<p>
And then four kinds of energy will harmonize with the
other factors. [These are the four right efforts,
padhana.] "Energy" means making the continuous
effort to develop wholesome states of mind and eliminate
unwholesome states of mind so that the mind becomes more
and more wholesome.
</p>
<div class="line"></div>

<a name="fourroads"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">The Four Roads to Success</a></p>

<p><em>[Iddhi-pada.]</em> When you have these four mental
factors you can be successful in anything you attempt,
including worldly work. If you want to study something,
for instance, you will be successful.
</p>
<p>
In the case of studying, "chanda" [concentration
of intention] means being interested in the subject you
want to learn. "Viriya" [concentration of
energy] means the effort to put energy into your studying.
"Citta" [concentration of consciousness,
citta-samadhi] means having intelligence or common sense
with what you're doing. And "vimamsa"
[concentration of investigation, vimamsa-samadhi] means to
repeat or go over the subject again and again. When you
have these four factors you can be successful in whatever
you attempt, even insight meditation.
</p>
<p>
So there are three groups of four factors each that will
harmonize in the meditator's mind. Then there are two
groups of five: The five spiritual faculties [indriya] and
the five spiritual powers [bala]. Then there are seven
factors of enlightenment [bojjhanga]. Including the
eight-fold path, they total thirty-seven factors. These
are called "bodhipakkhiya-dhamma" [the
thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment]. When these
thirty-seven mental factors join with the Four Noble
Truths, enlightenment happens right away, at that very
moment.
</p>
<p>
Then, from a citizen of the world, you become a lokuttara
[supramundane] citizen. You are no longer a lay person.
From that time on you are a noble person [an ariya,
enlightened one].
</p>
<p>
I hope that everyone understands what I am saying and can
get closer [to the goal]. Because everything is in you
already. Suffering is in you - rupa and nama are in you.
The causes of suffering, liking and disliking, are also in
you. The end of suffering is with you all the time, and
you are developing the eight-fold path right now.
</p>
<p>
It's only that the factors are not balanced enough
yet. And the other groups of dhamma have not harmonized
with them yet. But if you can keep going you can bring the
other groups to harmony; at that time your mindfulness
will have more power. It will be stronger, deeper, on a
higher and higher level. At that time you will know by
yourself, "Wow, now I am almost there."
</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<a name="question"></a>

<p class="hd"><a href="#toc">Questions and Answers</a></p>

<p>
All right; that's enough, but
if you have some questions I will give you time - about
five minutes more.
</p>
<p>
Meditator #1: Can you explain in more detail about
ultimate truths and ordinary truths?
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: Ultimate truth [paramatta sacca] is just
rupa and nama. Only rupa and nama are ultimate truth. The
name of a thing or the name of a person is ordinary truth
[sammuti-sacca]. Ultimate truth is without the name; there
is just an object. An object, meaning, rupa. The
"subject" is nama, who knows the object. Just
two things in the world are the truth, all right? One
thing stays [that is, manifests itself to the perception
so as to be known; this is the object, rupa], another
thing [nama] knows it.
</p>
<p>
For example, when we touch fire we experience heat; we
know that it is hot. That's the truth, right?
That's ultimate truth. When Thai people touch the fire
it's hot, too. When a Canadian touches fire it feels
hot. When Japanese or Chinese people touch the fire it
feels the same; that's ultimate truth. But I am Thai;
you are Canadian or Chinese or Japanese; that's
ordinary truth, right? The name or the nationality of the
person is different.
</p>
<p>
Meditator #2: Are all of the Buddha's teachings
ultimate truth?
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: No, he taught ordinary truth too. If he
just taught ultimate truth nobody could understand, right?
[Laughter.] He had to mention ordinary truth but he tried
to separate, separate so that the student would understand
which was ultimate truth and which was ordinary truth,
something like that. [In order to be understood, the
Buddha often used conventional expression. He would refer
to a "person," for example, even though no such
entity exists in ultimate terms. Hence, most of the sutras
or discourses use conventional language. On the other
hand, the Abhidhamma Pitaka (a many-volume work on
Buddhist metaphysics) refers only to absolute realities.]
</p>
<p>
Another example [Ven. Sopako rings a bell.] Like this
bell; everybody can hear the same thing, the same sound,
whether they are Thai or Indian or Laotian or American or
Canadian. The hearing is the same. But the ordinary truth
is different. English people call it the "bell."
Thai people call it "rakang." Japanese say
"gong." There is just one thing, but three
names, right? Three nationalities, three different names:
bell, gong, rakang. But it is the same sound. They are
hearing the same thing. Sound is ultimate truth. Hearing
is ultimate truth. Sound is rupa; hearing is nama.
That's ultimate truth. But the name of the bell is
ordinary truth. An English-speaking person has to say,
"that is a bell." But Thai people don't know
English so they say "no, not bell, rakang!" But
Japanese people, if they don't know English, say,
"no, not bell - gong."
</p>
<p>
That makes people fight, because of ordinary truth. But
there is never any fighting over ultimate truth because
sound is sound [the same vibration strikes everyone's
ear]. Hearing is only hearing. It has no nationality. It
is not American or Asian. There is no me, no you, no man,
and no woman in hearing, in sound. That is what is meant
by ultimate truth. It is without a name. There are no
males, no females, no names, no bell, no gong, no rakang -
just sound, just hearing, all right? [Likewise, there is
just seeing, tasting, smelling, touching, feeling and so
on; all of these are ultimate phenomena.]
</p>
<p>
[Sopako Bhikkhu gives meditation instructions to the
advanced students.] In meditation practice we try to
develop the mind so that mindfulness and concentration
balance each other, by following the step-by-step
technique. [We try to develop mindfulness and momentary
concentration simultaneously, so that they increase at the
same rate. To this end we practice a step-by-step method,
breaking each action down into a number of smaller,
discrete motions.]
</p>
<p>
But you are not beginners. All of you are either
intermediate or advanced meditators. So you can give up
the six steps of walking and the four steps of sitting.
[Meditators who have gained enough experience should give
up the step-by-step technique and observe objects more
naturally.] But what should you do, what should you focus
on when you give up the four steps of sitting or the six
steps of walking? How should you practice? Who can answer?
</p>
<p>
Meditator #3: Just be aware of whatever is going on.
</p>
<p>
Bhikkhu Sopako: That's correct. When you are able to
be aware of what is happening in the present moment, you
don't need to wait for objects to come. You don't
need to look for objects. But don't try to do it by
desire. Don't say, "I prefer to focus here; I
don't like this object. I'm waiting for that
object to come. I don't want to see this object here,
in the present moment." That's not correct. No
matter what object appears in the present moment you have
to be aware of that one, have to see or know or focus on
that object.
</p>
<p>
When we are focusing on an object in the present moment,
we cannot separate mindfulness from clear comprehension,
awareness, knowledge or wisdom, because they are mixed
together. All of them are working in the mind but since
none stands out by itself we cannot separate them, right?
</p>
<p>
It's like cooking; you put everything into the same
dish - soy sauce, pepper, sugar and other ingredients.
Then you taste it; if it is too hot, you say that there is
too much pepper. But the soy sauce and sugar are in there
too, it's just that they don't show. It's the
same thing in the mind; when one mental factor appears
stronger than the others, you can only recognize that one.
But mindfulness, awareness and wisdom are there too,
it's just that they do not show. We cannot know how
strong each of them is, only that they are working in the
present moment.
</p>
<p>
But we can understand this: when focusing in the present
moment right now, that means mindfulness. All right? That
means mindfulness. When you can see arising and passing
away, that's insight knowledge or vipassana nana. When
you can see impermanence in the present moment, or
suffering, or not-selfness, that is wisdom.
</p>
<p>
So it doesn't matter where the object comes from, or
whether it is good or bad. Just focus and forget it, good
or bad. Don't worry about that. That's the duty of
a yogi or meditator. You have to continue with whatever
object comes to you. You have to receive it or focus on
it. But if you are not sure whether your mindfulness and
concentration are strong enough or steady enough, then you
can go back to labeling the object.
</p>

<p>
For today, observe rising-falling only. Don't worry
about sitting or touching. But if you want to focus on the
sitting posture, then just observe sitting by itself for
five, ten or thirty minutes. Just sitting. Forget about
rising-falling. Or if you want to focus on touching, then
just observe touching by itself. Don't add
rising-falling or sitting. [Just keep practicing one
exercise, rather than combining the rising-falling,
sitting and touching exercises.] But ninety percent of
meditators observe rising-falling because we are always
breathing. Rising-falling is always present,
automatically. [We don't have to "make" an
object for mindfulness as we do when observing the
touch-points.] So you can keep practicing continuously
with rising-falling, even when you go back home.
</p>
<p>
In your daily practice, when the retreat is over, you
should observe rising-falling; only those two steps, for
whatever length of time you want to practice - ten
minutes, or fifteen minutes at a time, or half an hour. If
[concentration and mindfulness are] strong enough to give
up the label, then observe rising-falling without it. Give
up the mental notes and just observe naturally.
Mindfulness will keep the mind on the object so as to
understand impermanence in rising-falling, or suffering in
rising-falling, or non-self.
</p>
<p>
But don't make the mistake that impermanence,
suffering and non-self are three different things to see.
There is only one truth, one characteristic. But someone
has the temperament to see impermanence; that person
should focus on impermanence only. Others have the
temperament to see unsatisfactoriness. They should stay
with that characteristic and not worry about impermanence
or non-self, because these three are actually the same
one. Someone else has the temperament to see non-self;
that kind of meditator should keep observing non-self
only. Arising and passing away - that's non-self.
Changing all the time - that's non-self. The fact that
the object cannot stay - that's non-self. Just pay
attention to the characteristic that is clear to you
[because these three characteristics are merely different
aspects of a single truth].
</p>
<p>
Why is it that people can see three different
characteristics when there is only one truth? Why does
someone see impermanence, someone else,
unsatisfactoriness, and someone else, non-self? It depends
on the background or paramita of each person.
["Background" or "paramita" refers to
a natural aptitude that comes from wholesome actions
performed in the present existence or in previous lives.
Since people have performed different kinds of wholesome
actions they have different temperaments, and because of
that their minds perceive different facets of the truth.]
Those who have practiced generosity and morality more than
concentration, or more than activities pertaining to
wisdom, see impermanence more clearly. If someone has
practiced renunciation or attained strong concentration in
the past, that person sees suffering more clearly than
impermanence or non-self. But those who have developed
wisdom or have practiced by making strong resolutions can
see non-self more clearly than the other characteristics.
So it's important to know that even when there is one
truth we can see it from three different angles depending
on the person.
</p>
<p>
That's the instruction for sitting. Usually we do not
go through the different stages of practice as quickly as
we have in this retreat. Most of the time we observe
rising-falling for seven days, then add sitting for
another seven days, then add touching in the third week.
After one month the four steps of sitting will balance and
you can observe each object, rising-falling, sitting and
touching, equally well. But here it's just four days.
That's ok; you did very well. However, a
meditator's progress depends on his or her background,
paramita. It doesn't have to take a month to balance.
Someone can do it in just one day, very fast. They can
understand how to observe rising-falling right away
without the label and can go on to sitting and touching
correctly, right away. It depends on which of the four
types of meditator one is [for the first type, progress is
quick and pleasant; for the second, quick and unpleasant;
for the third, slow and pleasant; and for the fourth, slow
and unpleasant]. It doesn't always have to take a long
time. So, if you want to observe the sitting posture
today, just do that; don't pay attention to
rising-falling. Just notice how long your mind wanders, or
how long the object is clear or unclear.
</p>
<p>
When I practiced vipassana for seven months without a
break I could observe sitting continuously for a maximum
of two hours. During that time I was not interested in
rising-falling or anything else. The mind just kept
observing the sitting posture, without a break. But after
two hours some other object would come. Wandering mind
might arise but would disappear very fast as soon as I
focused on it. Or some kind of emotion would arise. That
meant that concentration could not stay on the object more
than two hours. Concentration went down but I still had
mindfulness. That's why wandering mind or emotion
could arise. If concentration still works with
mindfulness, these things cannot appear.
</p>
<p>
So today, just focus on rising-falling or sitting only. If
you want to test your concentration, just focus on
sitting. You might be able to stay with the object
steadily for five, ten or even twenty minutes. It depends
on the conditions you have. During that time you won't
have wandering mind at all. You won't feel any
emotions. You will not feel that another object can arise.
That means that momentary concentration is working with
mindfulness, with the sitting posture. It's easy to
test your concentration by observing the sitting posture.
</p>
<p>
But if you're observing rising-falling you can stay on
the object longer, even if you don't have as much
concentration. That's the secret; because you have
movement all the time, right? Whether you note it or not,
there is always movement when you breathe in and out.
That's why you don't have to have too much
concentration to observe it. With the sitting posture you
need to have good momentary concentration to work with
mindfulness. If someone has more paramita than myself, for
example, they can focus on the sitting posture for an
entire day without needing to focus on anything else.
Wandering mind or emotions do not arise; they just keep
knowing the sitting posture only; just that one object.
[But this differs from fixing the mind on the object to
the point of trance, because in vipassana the meditator
still observes sitting arising and passing away from
moment-to-moment.] The wisdom or paramita of each person
is different.
</p>
<p>
Just like when you test the depth of the ocean by dropping
a line down. It's the same thing in the dhamma; the
depth of knowledge of each person differs. The Buddha, for
example, had deeper knowledge than the arahants [fully
enlightened beings] or disciples.
</p>
<p>
About walking meditation: choose the step that was clear
to you this morning, whether four, five or six step. If
none of them were clear, do three step or two step.
Usually you can keep three because that's in the
middle between one and six. So if four, five and six are
very hard for you or uncomfortable, then just continue
with three step. You can practice three step when you go
back home, too.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes you might look like you are walking normally,
just slower than normal, but mindfulness can perceive one
step of the foot as having three distinct parts or
motions. So you have three motions from nama, or from
sensation, or feeling or knowing, not three motions
objectively. Subjectively, mindfulness will make the
experience into three steps: lifting, moving and placing.
Mindfulness will do this automatically, very fast. When
mindfulness is strong it separates your experience of the
object into several smaller steps by itself. Sometimes
when I move my hand or do something else I don't focus
on the object step-by-step, but mindfulness makes it that
way by itself, so that I can see the individual moments of
the movement, even when I'm not following the
technique but moving normally.
</p>
<p>
When I practiced vipassana for seven months continuously,
after the third month, even when I walked in a way that
appeared almost normal, I could still perceive one action
as having separate moments. When I was doing something I
just moved slowly, not step-by-step. But on the
"inside" I continued to experience the movement
as a moment-to-moment phenomena, even though I was moving
normally on the "outside." Because, who is
knowing [what is it that is knowing]? Nama is knowing.
What is it that arises and falls, or is born and then
dies? Consciousness. Consciousness is like a vibration. A
vibration arising and passing away, arising and passing
away, arising and passing away.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you see something, for example, it is not a
single consciousness seeing that object for two or three
minutes, no. There are many, many individual moments of
consciousness, one after another, but we don't know
that. They are very subtle, very fast, very deep. It's
the same thing with hearing. There is not just one
consciousness when hearing a sound; there are many, many
separate moments of consciousness that are hearing - a
hundred or a thousand - depending on how long that sound
is still there. But we cannot see that. It depends on the
wisdom of each person whether he or she can have knowledge
to see the deeper level of consciousness.
</p>
<p>
[Bhikkhu Sopako holds up his finger and moves it slightly,
one time.] During a single finger-movement like this, the
Lord Buddha could see almost a million moments of
movement. He could see about a million different moments
of consciousness arise and fall away during the single
finger-movement. But to our perception, we see only one
moment. For us, movement arises and falls away just one
time; we see it as just a single movement. We can see the
finger move, and we can know that it was nama [the mind]
that ordered the finger to move, and that the agent that
knows the finger-motion is also nama. But it's just
one movement. We can see something arise and pass away
only once. But those who have deeper or higher wisdom can
see many, many increments in that movement, can see
arising and passing away or the moment-to-moment of nama
happen many, many times during that single action.
</p>
<p>
So during walking this morning just keep practicing
whatever level feels clear, or the one in which you feel
mindfulness can be steady. If four step is clear, for
example, just keep doing four step for the whole day. You
can choose. I will look and see which step you are doing.
If you are doing it correctly then I won't need to
interview and ask what step you did today. I will see, I
will know that you are doing three, or four, or five or
six or two step or one step, if you are doing it
correctly. But if you're not doing it correctly I will
ask what step you're doing. If you say, "Four
step," for instance, I will tell you or show you how
to do that step correctly. That's the duty of the
teacher. If you are already practicing correctly, the
teacher does not need to interrupt you because that breaks
the continuity of practice. Today everyone has freedom to
practice independently.
</p>
<p>
For advanced students I do not give instruction often. I
just let them practice more, because having an interview
or listening to instruction like this makes them break
their continuity, and that isn't good, either. But if
someone does not understand then it's important to
explain, even if it means they have to stop practicing for
awhile. That is better than to keep going without right
understanding, with confusion, thinking, "Am I doing
this well or not?" or, "I don't know whether
I'm doing it right or not. How can I know?" Then
thoughts like these are always in the mind. You're
always wondering, "How can I do it right, how can I
know whether I'm following the correct path?"
That means that you are practicing with confusion. How can
you be successful?
</p>
<p>
Or sometimes you practice with desire, thinking, "I
want to be successful, I want to be a good meditator. I
don't want to lose mindfulness or have wandering
mind." Right? When the mind doesn't wander, you
think, "Wow, good. I am doing well now." When
the mind wanders, "Oh, this is terrible. Why
isn't meditation helping me? Why did I come here? My
mind isn't calm at all. I don't have any
concentration." Then you feel upset or disappointed.
</p>
<p>
When your attitude to practice, and your practice itself,
are not correct, then all kinds of things will be going
on. If practice is good, you'll have attachment. If
it's bad, you'll be disappointed or sad. But
that's not correct. If you are practicing correctly,
you won't feel that it's good or bad; you will not
feel any liking or disliking, you will just continue more
and more. That's correct.
</p>
<p>
Today I have not given much instruction, but I will
demonstrate eating meditation at lunch time. If you can
follow that technique it will be very good for you.
Everything I know, I want to share with you. I don't
want to carry it [his knowledge] back to Chicago, all
right? [Laughter.] . . .
</p>
<p>
[Later that day] I would like to give more detail about
eating meditation. Before I came here I gave a retreat at
the Thai temple in Chicago. There were about twenty-one
people, all very serious meditators. All of them were able
to follow the practice of mindful eating.
</p>
<p>
All right; eating meditation. You have to be aware of
seeing the food first. If greed arises for the food, then
you have to concentrate on that. Or you have to
concentrate on the feeling of hunger.
</p>
<p>
What is the reason that we have to eat? Why do all beings
need to eat food? Because if they don't they'll
die, right? But they do not die right away. After seven
days without food, some parts or cells of the body die and
disappear. After seven days without food, even though you
are still alive, some parts of the body begin to die. So
the food we eat can help the body have life for seven
days. That's why it was possible for some arahants to
meditate for seven days without eating or drinking
anything. But after seven days they had to get up and eat.
</p>
<p>
That state is called "nirodha-samapatti"
[attainment of extinction. It is a temporary suspension of
consciousness, perception and feeling]. Those who attain
it have no feeling at all when sitting. The breath becomes
very subtle so that it's almost imperceptible; you
cannot see the rising and falling of the abdomen. They
cannot feel the heat of fire, cannot feel a knife cutting
them. "Nirodha" means to give up knowing any
object. But it is not really concentration; it happens by
the power of attaining the highest level of consciousness
or wisdom to separate nama from rupa, the object. These
people cannot see, know or feel anything at all for seven
days. They are able to continue longer than seven days but
they know that the body needs to eat, so they come out of
meditation. That's nirodha samapatti. The person can
control the mind or can sit without eating or drinking,
without feeling or knowing at all. So we should not eat
out of desire or lust. We should not eat for doing some
unwholesome bodily action. We should eat only so the body
can stay alive.
</p>
<p>
When someone offers food to the monks, the monks chant in
Pali very fast before eating. Some monks chant silently in
their minds, others chant aloud. The words they say mean
something like this: "I do not eat food to have
happiness or to follow desire; I eat food so that I may
have life in the world for teaching dhamma or practicing
dhamma or helping people." It's the same with
meditators. We have to remember that we are eating so that
the body can have energy to practice meditation. If not in
a retreat, we can remember that we are eating to have a
strong body for working or following right livelihood
while living in the world. So after you focus on the
feeling of hunger, and after you understand the reason to
eat, then you should try and concentrate on moving
step-by-step.
</p>
<p>
Eating this way takes time; in my experience, more than
two hours. It may not be convenient or comfortable here
because we are sitting on chairs, eating at a high table
and it is not easy to move the hand up and go straight -
we have to lift it up too high. But when I was practicing
seven months they only cooked food that was easy for the
meditators to pick up and we sat on the floor. The table
wasn't too high or too low. It was easy to pick up the
food, to take the spoon or fork and cut the food with just
one utensil. They didn't bring any food that was hard
to cut. Everything was bite-sized. Not like the grapefruit
this morning! No way to eat that. You have to cut, cut,
cut. . . [laughter.]
</p>
<p>
So you have to take the food [place it on the fork or
spoon] and then move your hand slowly until the fork or
spoon touches your mouth. Then open the mouth and take the
food. But don't chew at first - not until you put the
fork back. Then close the eyes. Taste will appear. If
it's a strong taste you have to focus on that before
chewing. While you are chewing, taste will be there too,
so you'll have two objects at the same time. <em>[But
only focus on one.]</em> If the flavor is strong or spicy
then you shouldn't focus on chewing; just focus on
knowing taste.
</p>
<p>
If the taste is bland you have to focus on the movement of
the jaw, on chewing, until you swallow the food. Then open
the eyes. Look at the food again, and note the intention
to take the food again; then move the hand, step-by-step.
Sometimes it takes two hours or more [to finish a meal.]
Sometimes you feel full after eating only half the food
because you're too tired, right? [Laughter.] It takes
too long. [Laughter.] Sometimes, if the food is soft, you
just swallow right away because it takes too long to chew
and desire wants to swallow immediately. There are many
things happening. You can get a lot of experience with
eating because most people have a great deal of desire
when it comes to food. [For step-by-step instructions on
